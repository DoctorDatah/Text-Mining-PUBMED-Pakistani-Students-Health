AB  - BACKGROUND: Global burden of cardiovascular diseases is alarming which is 
      intricately linked with health literacy. To what extent improvement in health 
      literacy can lower down cardiovascular diseases occurrence has not yet properly 
      documented. This study focused on assessing the knowledge and existing lifestyle 
      behavior about cardiac diseases among university students. We further aimed to 
      improve this awareness after imparting an educational intervention among 
      undergraduate non-medical students to sensitize them about risk factors. METHOD: A 
      pre and post approaches with cross sectional study design was conducted in 
      University of Gujrat during April-September 2017. Using structured questionnaire 
      comprising of response items about hypertension, heart attack, stroke and preventive 
      practices, data was randomly collected from students (n = 100). Survey respondents 
      were also given a lecture regarding cardiovascular diseases awareness and a post 
      test evaluation was also conducted on same group of students. RESULTS: With response 
      rate of 86.95%, mean age of participating students was 21.2 (SD ± 1.34) years. 
      Female students comprised of 53% out of which 57% were from rural background. 
      Assessment of cardiovascular disease knowledge revealed maximum mean pre test score 
      30.53 (SD ± 7.61) and for post test 40.65 (SD ± 4.34) (p < 0.00). Mean score for 
      using preventive practices was 13.02 (SD ± 2.97) for pre test whereas for post test 
      it was 14.09 (SD ± 2.90) (p < 0.00). Intervention impact was significant on 
      hypertension related complications (p < 0.000), symptoms of heart attack 
      (p < 0.000), symptoms of stroke (p < 0.000) and preventive practices (p < 0.00). 
      CONCLUSION: Findings presented here show a fair degree of awareness among university 
      students about study title prior to any educational intervention. However, by 
      attending educational session, a significant increase in the positive lifestyle 
      behavior and knowledge was noticed. We conclude that health promotion activities in 
      educational institutes to sensitize students can bring rational changes in Pakistani 
      society to promote healthy behavior and minimize cardiovascular disease risks.

TI  - Moodle and Online Learning in Pakistani Medical Universities: An opportunity worth 
      exploring in higher education and research.
PG  - 1076-1078
AB  - Medical education and pedagogy have undergone a massive change in the 21st century. 
      Still, there is a lack of computer-assisted learning in most of the Pakistani 
      medical schools. Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment (Moodle), is a 
      user-friendly, online learning management system that is being used globally in 
      teaching online courses to undergraduates, residents and doctoral students. Many 
      international universities and medical institutes have integrated Moodle in their 
      medical education and literature supports the use and importance of such tools. 
      Still very few Pakistani medical schools are utilizing Moodle and similar 
      blended-learning approaches in medical education. We recommend that Pakistani 
      medical schools should consider using Moodle as an online learning platform to 
      promote blended-learning in order to enhance the training of students and faculty, 
      and improving their standards in line with the international standards.

LID - 21
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess Pakistani pharmacy students' perceptions of complementary and 
      alternative medicine (CAM), the frequency with which they use CAM, and barriers to 
      use of CAM. METHOD: A CAM health belief questionnaire was administered to 595 
      students enrolled in a 5-year doctor of pharmacy program (PharmD) in Pakistan. 
      RESULTS: Attitudes of students towards CAM were positive. Lack of evidence 
      supporting CAM practices was considered to be the major barrier toward more students 
      using CAM. A majority of students (79%) agreed that clinical care should integrate 
      conventional medicine and CAM practices. Many CAM-based therapies, such as dietary 
      supplements, massage, herbal medicines, and homoeopathic medicines were used by the 
      students. Significant gender differences in attitude were observed, with male 
      students having more conservative attitudes toward CAM use. A high percentage of 
      students desired more training in CAM. CONCLUSIONS: Pakistani students exhibited 
      positive attitudes about the value of CAM and most felt that CAM should be included 
      in the PharmD curriculum.

TI  - Attitudes of Pakistani and Pakistani heritage medical students regarding 
      professionalism at a medical college in Karachi, Pakistan.
PG  - 150
LID - 10.1186/1756-0500-7-150 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increased interest in professionalism has been reported in the field 
      of medical education due to concerns regarding deterioration of humanism and 
      professional values in the teaching and practice of medicine. The primary aim of 
      this study was to assess attitudes of Pakistani and Pakistani heritage students at a 
      medical college in Pakistan about important elements of professionalism that an 
      ideal medical doctor should possess. A further objective of the study was to 
      determine students' preferred ways of learning professionalism. METHODS: A written 
      survey was distributed to undergraduate medical students at a public sector medical 
      college at Karachi, Pakistan in 2011. Using the Penn State College of Medicine 
      (PSCOM) Professionalism Questionnaire, attitudes of medical students of semester 1, 
      5, and 8 regarding professionalism were assessed anonymously. RESULTS: The mean age 
      of the students was 21.11 ± 2.72 years. Forty-three percent of the respondents were 
      male. Forty percent of the students held Pakistani citizenship. Thirty-five percent 
      students were US citizens with Pakistani parents and twenty-five percent were 
      Pakistani heritage students that had dual citizenships. No significant differences 
      in the elements of professionalism (Accountability, Altruism, Duty, Excellence, 
      Honesty & Integrity and Respect) mean scores or in the overall mean score of 
      professionalism among the various classes were found. The total overall Cronbach 
      alpha value for all elements of the professionalism in the selected classes was 
      above 0.9. The most preferred methods for learning professionalism were role 
      modeling by faculty, case based scenarios and role plays. CONCLUSION: The students 
      rated all the attributes of professionalism as important and there was no difference 
      across the study years. The overall internal consistency of each element of 
      professionalism was high in different classes. Faculty role models, case based 
      scenarios and role plays may be used to teach professionalism. As a great majority 
      of students were having a Pakistani heritage rather than complete Pakistani born and 
      bred background, hence findings of the survey may not be taken as representative of 
      typical Pakistani medical students.

AB  - This study investigates mental health, access to treatment, suicidality, and 
      bullying among Pakistani university students. Data were collected from a sample of 
      355 university students in Pakistan. For reference, we compared these data to a 
      sample previously collected from German and Chinese students. Results indicated 
      relatively poorer mental health and access to mental health treatments among the 
      Pakistani sample, including a higher rate of recent suicidal ideation and bullying. 
      Acknowledgment of these issues in Pakistani culture would be a good starting point 
      to work on developing solutions to enhance the overall mental health of Pakistani 
      students.

TI  - Impact of Poor Sleep Quality on the Academic Performance of Medical Students.
PG  - e4357
LID - 10.7759/cureus.4357 [doi]
LID - e4357
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adequate sleep has a crucial role in enhancing cognitive skills 
      especially memory retention. Poor night time sleep quality and the consequent 
      daytime sleepiness affect physical and cognitive health of students and their 
      academic performance. The aim of this study is to find whether or not poor academic 
      performance is a consequence of poor sleep quality among Pakistani medical students. 
      METHODS: It was an observational, cross-sectional study conducted with undergraduate 
      medical students. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess the sleep 
      quality. Academic performance was assessed by mean grade point average (GPA) of the 
      students. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social 
      Sciences (SPSS) 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). RESULTS: There were 512 (64.24%) 
      students with global PSQI score ≥5 indicating poor sleep quality. The mean GPA of 
      poor sleepers was 2.92 ± 1.09 which was significantly lower than that of good 
      sleepers (p < 0.0001). In the group of students who scored lower GPA (2.0-2.7), 
      28.2% had very bad subjective sleep quality, 29.05% had sleep latency of 16-30 min, 
      29.4% had sleep duration of <5-7 h, 27.8% had sleep efficiency of <85%, and 37.7% 
      experienced daytime dysfunction almost every day. CONCLUSION: Medical students of 
      Pakistan have poor sleep quality which has a negative impact on their academic 
      performance. Adequate sleep is essential to refresh the students every day and help 
      them in learning and memory processing. Medical students and their facilitators 
      should comprehend the negative effects of sleep deprivation on student academics and 
      should take adequate measures to improve the sleep quality of students.

TI  - Knowledge and attitudes about health research amongst a group of Pakistani medical 
      students.
PG  - 54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health research training is an important part of medical education. This 
      study was conducted to assess the level of knowledge and attitudes regarding health 
      research in a group of Pakistani medical students at Aga Khan University, Karachi. 
      METHODS: It was a cross-sectional pilot study conducted among a group of Pakistani 
      medical students. Through stratified random sampling, a pre-tested, structured and 
      validated questionnaire was administered to 220 medical students. Knowledge and 
      attitudes were recorded on a scale (graduated in percentages). RESULTS: Mean scores 
      of students were 49.0% on knowledge scale and 53.7% on attitude scale. Both 
      knowledge and attitudes improved significantly with increasing years of study in 
      medical college [Regression coefficient 4.10 (p-value; 0.019) and 6.67 (p-value; < 
      0.001) for knowledge and attitudes, respectively]. CONCLUSION: Medical students 
      demonstrate moderate level of knowledge and attitude towards health research. 
      Intensive training in this regard is associated with significant improvement in 
      knowledge and attitudes of students towards health research.

AB  - Introduction In most healthcare models, the first interaction of a patient is with a 
      general physician. The inspection of the oral cavity is a mandatory component of the 
      general physical examination performed by a physician. This helps detect any oral 
      pathology and make suitable referrals. Therefore, adequate oral health awareness is 
      essential for physicians. Our study aimed at evaluating the oral health practices 
      among physicians working in a private teaching setup in Islamabad, Pakistan. Methods 
      A cross-sectional study involving 144 physicians teaching undergraduate medical 
      students at Shifa College of Medicine and its affiliated hospital, Shifa 
      International Hospital, was conducted. Participants were interviewed through a 
      self-designed questionnaire. Later, each participant demonstrated their teeth 
      brushing technique on a standard model of the oral cavity, which was assessed 
      against a checklist conforming to the modified bass technique. A video clip showing 
      the aforementioned brushing technique was shown at the end of the interview. The 
      collected data was analyzed on IBM's statistical package for the social sciences 
      (SPSS) version 21.  Results Toothpaste was the top choice (97.2%) of teeth cleaning 
      tool with 69% participants brushing their teeth two times a day and 
      56.9% using toothbrushes with bristles of medium texture. The use of mouthwash 
      (32.6%) and dental floss (11.1%) was considerably low. Dental caries and teeth 
      discoloration were seen in 46.5% and 43.8% physicians, respectively. An alarmingly 
      low number of physicians (31.9%) claimed to have read guidelines regarding oral 
      health. This translated into most participants (78.5%) visiting a dentist only when 
      needed. Only 4.9% participants performed all components of the modified bass 
      technique to clean teeth on the oral cavity model, with up to 22.9% unable to 
      perform a single step accurately.  Conclusion The oral health knowledge and 
      practices of physicians were found to be suboptimal and necessitate the integration 
      of oral health awareness in the medical curriculum. A multiprofessional approach 
      with physicians in crucial roles is required to address the burden of dental 
      diseases globally.

TI  - A Quantitative Study of Empathy in Pakistani Medical Students: A Multicentered 
      Approach.
PG  - 294-299
LID - 10.1177/2150131917716233 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the empathy level of undergraduate medical students in 
      Pakistan. Three hypotheses are developed based on the literature review. (1) Female 
      medical students have a higher level of empathy than do male students. (2) Empathy 
      scores vary during the medical school years in Pakistani students. (3) Medical 
      students interested in people-oriented specialties would score higher than the 
      students interested in technology-oriented specialties. METHODS: This is a 
      quantitative inquiry approach using a cross-sectional design of 1453 students from 8 
      Pakistani medical schools, both private and state. The sample consists of 41.1% (n = 
      597) male students and 58.9% (n = 856) female students. Empirical data are collected 
      using the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE), a well-validated 
      self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean empathy score among students is 
      4.77 with a standard deviation of 0.72. The results show that there is no 
      statistically significant association between the empathy scores and gender, 
      t(1342.36) = -0.053, P = .95). There is a statistically significant difference 
      between the empathy scores and the years of medical school, F(14, 1448) = 4.95, P = 
      .01. Concerning the specialty interests, there is no statistically significant 
      difference between the empathy score and specialty interests. CONCLUSION: The 
      findings of this study showed that in Western countries, medical students performed 
      better than Pakistani medical students on the empathy scale. This finding has 
      important implications for Pakistani medical educators to improve the interpersonal 
      skills of medical students in the context of patient care. Inconsistent with our 
      expectations and experiences, our findings do not support that female medical 
      students scored better than their male counterparts on the empathy scale. Because of 
      the nature of a cross-sectional study, it is impossible to argue the decline of 
      empathy during medical school training.

TI  - Health professional students' perceptions regarding their role in tobacco control: 
      findings from the Global Health Professional Students Survey, Pakistan, 2011.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/1747-597X-9-25 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An important way of reducing tobacco use is to train the health 
      professional (HP) students to assist in tobacco cessation by educating patients and 
      public. In order to shape their thoughts for the desired role, it is vital to 
      understand their existing perceptions regarding HP's role in tobacco control. Thus, 
      the aim of our study was to find out the perceptions of Pakistani HP students 
      regarding their future role in tobacco control, and examine factors associated with 
      negative perceptions. METHODS: Secondary data analysis of the Global Health 
      Professional Students Survey, Pakistan, 2011 was performed. Study population 
      included 3445 health professional students in third year of graduate level programs. 
      The dependent variable (perceptions of HP students), was developed using four 
      questions from the survey. Students who did not regard HP's role in tobacco control 
      were labeled as having negative perceptions. Logistic regression analyses were 
      conducted to analyze association between HP students' perceptions and various 
      socio-demographic, attitudinal and knowledge related factors; and were reported as 
      adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: We found that 44.8% (n = 
      1542) of students do not regard HPs as role model for their patients and public, and 
      perceive that HPs do not play an important part in patient's quitting tobacco use. 
      These negative perceptions were associated with male sex (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.02 - 
      1.53, p value 0.028), and poor knowledge about tobacco cessation techniques (OR = 
      1.32, 95% CI 1.12 - 1.55, p value < 0.001). Negative perceptions were also 
      associated with their attitudes towards ban on: tobacco advertisements (OR = 1.67, 
      95% CI 1.13 - 2.48, p value 0.010); and tobacco use at public places (OR = 1.60, 95% 
      CI 1.26 - 2.03, p value < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The role of HPs for tobacco control is 
      fairly under-perceived by HP students, and the undesired negative perceptions are 
      associated with male sex, poor knowledge about tobacco use cessation techniques and 
      negative attitudes towards legislative control. A comprehensive approach, focusing 
      on these aspects should be adopted to train HPs, in order to utilize them as an 
      effective manpower for tobacco control.

TI  - Pakistani medical students' specialty preference and the influencing factors.
PG  - 713-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the specialty preferences of Pakistani medical students and 
      the factors which influence medical students to make the decision regarding which 
      specialty to pursue. METHODS: Both basic sciences and clinical students from four 
      medical colleges of Pakistan, i.e., Dow Medical College, Sindh Medical College, 
      Liaquat National Medical College and Muhammad Medical College, were included in the 
      cross-sectional survey during the period of July 2008 to Jan' 2009. After ethical 
      acceptance, data was collected using convenient sampling technique. The 
      questionnaire covered the following demographic details: 13 common specialties and 
      15 influencing factors. RESULTS: Questionnaires included in the analysis were 771. 
      Most students gave preference to surgery and its associated sub-specialties (50.3%) 
      followed by internal medicine (26.8%), paediatrics (23.2%), dermatology (16.7%), 
      gynaecology and obstetrics (16.7%), psychiatry (13.1%), radiology (10.8%), ENT 
      (8.8%), anaesthesiology (8.7%), administrative medicine (8.6%), orthopaedics (8.2%), 
      ophthalmology (7.5%), and laboratory medicine (6.1%). The highly considered factors 
      (regarding specialties) chosen by 70% of the medical students were: applicable to 
      respective personalities of the individuals, prestige and respect, international 
      opportunities, and time commitment. Surgical-skills, job availability, financial 
      rating, academic performance, and a role model were moderately influencing factors. 
      Hospital environment, parents, general practice, peer-pressure and personal health 
      were the least influential. CONCLUSION: This trend suggests competition in surgery 
      and its sub-specialties along with internal medicine, paediatrics, dermatology, 
      gynaecology and obstetrics. Specialty suited to personality, time commitment, 
      prestige/respect and international opportunity, influenced more than 70% of the 
      students.

AB  - Background Few studies have explored factors affecting preference of medical 
      students towards general practice as a career choice. We conducted a survey in 
      Karachi across various public and private sector medical colleges to examine factors 
      associated with students' general practice career aspirations in Karachi, Pakistan. 
      Methods From January to March 2018, we distributed a 21-item questionnaire to final 
      year medical students in eight medical schools. The survey asked students about 
      their top three career preferences from 19 specialty fields, their demographics and 
      their career priorities. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the 
      effect of each item. Results A total of 1400 responses were obtained. The top five 
      specialty fields chosen by students with their numbers were: internal medicine, 898 
      (64.2%); general practice, 337 (24.1%); pediatrics, 449 (32.1%); surgery, 380 
      (27.2%); and emergency medicine, 243 (17.4%). The "intent to inherit existing 
      practice" and "other academic or professional experiences prior to medical 
      school" had a positive association with choosing general practice while "having a 
      physician parent'' had a negative association among the medical students 
      demographics after adjusting for other covariates in the multivariable logistic 
      regression. Medical students who ranked "clinical diagnostic reasoning", 
      "community-oriented practice", "involvement in preventive medicine", and "frequent 
      patient communication" as highly important were more likely to choose general 
      practice, whereas, "access to advanced medical fields", "mastering advanced 
      procedures", and "depth rather than breadth of practice" were less likely to be 
      associated with general practice aspiration. Conclusion The study's results depicted 
      limited interest of family medicine as a career option in graduating students, and 
      pointed out the factors that likely influence the choice of general practice as a 
      career are clinical diagnostic reasoning, community-oriented practice and preventive 
      medicine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health professional (HP) students may have an important role in 
      controlling future tobacco use of their patients, and public at large. It is 
      important to understand their existing level of awareness and support for national 
      anti-tobacco policies. We thus aim to explore Pakistani HP students' existing 
      attitudes towards national anti-tobacco policy and examine factors associated with 
      lack of awareness, and support amongst them. METHODS: Secondary data analysis of the 
      Global Health Professional Students Survey, Pakistan, 2011 was performed. Study 
      population included 4,235 health professional students enrolled in third year of 
      graduate level HP programs. The policy support metrics were developed using six 
      questions from the survey. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to 
      analyze association between HP students' awareness, and support for anti-tobacco 
      policy (outcome variables), and various socio-demographic, attitudinal, and 
      knowledge related factors. Descriptive statistics are reported as proportions, and 
      results of logistic regression analysis were reported as odds ratios with 95% 
      confidence interval. RESULTS: Overall, among HP students, 10.8% (n=391) were current 
      smokers, and 26.7% (n=965) of them were cigarette experimenters. Almost half, 
      (46.1%, n=1666) of the HP students did not have an awareness of the official policy 
      banning tobacco use in their school buildings and clinics; and only one in ten 
      (9.4%, n=338) of them did not support anti-tobacco policies. Students were less 
      likely to be aware if they had second hand exposure at home/work (OR=0.73, 95% CI 
      (0.57-0.92), p-value <0.01). Furthermore, students who were current smokers 
      (OR=0.21, 95% CI (0.08-0.56), or cigarette experimenters (OR=0.42, 95% CI 
      (0.26-0.70), p-value <0.01), were least likely to support anti-tobacco policies. 
      CONCLUSION: We found that HP students lack awareness of anti-tobacco policies; and 
      were less likely to support such efforts if they were current smokers. These 
      findings may help in understanding existing perceptions of the future care givers in 
      Pakistan. Future anti-tobacco efforts and HP training programs may target the 
      smoking HPs to enhance their full support in this regard.

TI  - Quality of life of Pakistani medical students studying in a private institution.
PG  - 579-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To find the quality of life of medical students using a World Health 
      Organisation questionnaire. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted in 
      February 2015 at Shifa College of Medicine, Islamabad, Pakistan, and comprised 
      students studying in an integrated medical education system. The shortened version 
      of World Health Organisation Quality of Life questionnaire comprising 26 items was 
      used. Consecutive non-probability sampling was used to collect data which was 
      analysed using SPSS 21. RESULTS: Out of 417 medical students, 185(44.4%) were male 
      and 232(55.6%) were female. Of them, 165(39.6%) were in pre-clinical years, while 
      252(60.4%) were in clinical years. Overall, 347(83.2%) students rated their quality 
      of life as "good" or "very good". Environmental domain had the highest mean score of 
      70.43±16.38 while Psychological Health domain had the lowest mean score of 
      66.48±15.64. CONCLUSIONS: Medical education affects students' health, thus their 
      quality of life varies. Identification of this is very important, since long-term 
      stress can induce some permanent personality changes in individuals.

TI  - Motivation and factors affecting sports participation: a cross-sectional study on 
      female medical students in Pakistan.
PG  - 1327-1333
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors associated with participation of Pakistani 
      female students in organised sports at a university in a rural setting in Pakistan. 
      METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during March and April 2017 at the 
      Peoples University of Medical & Health Sciences for Women, Nawabshah in the Sindh 
      province of Pakistan, and comprised undergraduate female students who got injured 
      during the "Sports Week" organized at the university and visited the on-site 
      physiotherapy camp. Data collection tools included physical activity and leisure 
      motivation scale, sport motivation scale, and athlete fear avoidance questionnaire. 
      SPSS v20 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 403 students participating in 
      the Sports Week, sports injuries were reported by 127(31.51%) students. Regular 
      physical activity was reported by only 28(22%) participants. Overuse was the most 
      common cause of sports injuries 67(52.8%). Ankle was the main affected site 
      31(24.4%). The most common injury types were cramps 59(46.5%) and sprains 58(45.7%). 
      Use of improper technique was observed in 61(48%) students. The most common 
      intrinsic motives were 'enjoyment', with a mean value of 21.3±2.71, and 'to know' 
      21.71±5.2. The most common extrinsic motives were 'physical condition', with a mean 
      value of 21.51±2.81, and 'identified regulation' 21.74±5.6. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence 
      of sports injuries in female university students was high. The students should be 
      trained about the proper way of sports participation.

TI  - Perceived Social Support and Mental Health Problems Among Pakistani University 
      Students.
PG  - 1004-1008
AB  - Despite the growing number of cross-cultural studies focusing on psychological 
      problems, little is known about social support outside of western civilization, 
      particularly among people in South Asian cultures. This study examined the cultural 
      orientation regarding perceived social support and psychological problems among 912 
      undergraduate students (age 19-26) studying at COMSATS Institute of Information 
      Technology, Lahore, Pakistan. The present study supported variance in cultural 
      values regarding the relative prominence of sources of support in collectivist 
      culture indicating that low levels of family support were related to various 
      psychological problems. Further, low levels of peer support were related to 
      depression, anxiety, and interpersonal sensitivity. While familial support played a 
      bigger role than peer support in affecting psychological problems, peer support also 
      had a role to play. The results may help counsellors and researchers to identify 
      more effectively the population of students at high risk for mental illness and 
      develop culturally effective interventions to address this significant and growing 
      public health issue.

TI  - The practice of self-medication among Pakistani university students.
PG  - 1377-1381
AB  - Self-medication refers to the selection and use of medicines without prescription by 
      an individuals' personal responsibility as a cure of self-identified disease. 
      Although its rationale, type and extent may different from culture to culture, it is 
      globally prevalent practice. In Pakistan no research is available on the use of 
      self-medication among university students. The existing study was conducted to 
      investigate the frequency and percentages of branded medicines used by university 
      students, reasons and rationale behind self-medication. It was a survey research 
      design and descriptive statistics were collected regarding the use of self- 
      medication. Hence, a sample of 300 students was employed between the age range of 
      16-25 years (M = 20.23, SD = 2. 76). The respondents filled a questionnaire 
      regarding socio-economic and demographic variables, use of self-medication, and 
      medication knowledge. Information was obtained on the conditions treated with 
      medication, the medications used, and attitude towards self-medication. Results 
      indicated mostly used type of self-medication was allopathic (f = 230, 77%). 
      Headache was found to be more frequently prevalent disease. Most frequently used 
      medicine was Disprin (M = 49.68, SD = 15. 14) as a cure of headaches and other body 
      pains. Financial problems (f = 90, 30%) left over drugs (f = 46, 15%) and easy 
      accessibility (f =38, 12.7%) were found to be the strongest factors in using 
      self-medication. Moreover significant differences appeared in the use of type of 
      medicines between boys and girls. The study concluded that self-medication is widely 
      used practice among university students in Pakistan.

TI  - Cardiovascular health--behaviour of medical students in Karachi.
PG  - 492-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the health behaviour and perceptions of medical students 
      towards cardiovascular disease. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional survey was 
      conducted on 203 Pakistani medical students enrolled in a private medical college in 
      Karachi, Pakistan using systematic random sampling. It was based on a 
      self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Eight percent smoked, 9% were overweight, 
      33% had a family history of coronary artery disease, 32% regulated dietary fat 
      intake, 28% exercised regularly, 62.1% knew personal blood pressure and 5.4% 
      personal cholesterol levels. Regarding developing cardiovascular disease in the 
      future, 62% showed concern but only 54% of these adopted preventive practices. About 
      46% believed medical college life had a harmful effect on their health. Gender, 
      family history and personal health status perception were behavior modifying 
      influences (p<0.05). Reasons reported for their behavior were: no need of prevention 
      at their age (38.3%) and never thinking about these issues (37.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      study shows a high prevalence of coronary artery disease family history, 
      inappropriate dietary intake, physical inactivity; poor screening practices and lack 
      of awareness. The results underscore the urgent need to promote preventive knowledge 
      and practices among medical students, if they are to become prevention oriented 
      physicians and counsel patients on preventive strategies to counter the rapidly 
      increasing burden of cardiovascular diseases effectively.

AB  - With recent technological advancement, a major shift in the lifestyle of individuals 
      has been observed. This change is more evident in youth in terms of sleep pattern 
      changes and socialization. It is therefore important to assess the quality of life 
      in this productive group of society. The protocol consisted of the Urdu version of 
      the demographic questionnaires, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the 
      Cohen-Hoberman Inventory of Physical symptoms (CHIPS) and the World Health 
      Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF). A total of 150 young adults (boys = 62, 
      girls = 88) were included through convenience sampling. A significant positive 
      association was found between poor sleep quality and health complaints (r = 0.53**). 
      However, a significant negative association was found between poor sleep and quality 
      of life in terms of physical health, psychological health, social relationships and 
      the environment (r = -0.57**, -0.35**, -0.39**, -0.33**), respectively, which 
      indicates the importance of sleep in determining quality of life. Furthermore, the 
      majority of the participants (57%) reported good sleep quality and low health 
      complaints [M = 15.08, standard deviation (SD) = 13.29] whereas 43% of participants 
      reported poor sleep quality, more health complaints (M = 32.94, SD = 22.59) and poor 
      quality of life. It shows that most of the participants are healthy and able to 
      manage their daily routine, work commitment and provide services for country's 
      development.

TI  - Suicidal ideation in Pakistani college students.
PG  - 125-7
AB  - Suicidal behavior includes ideation, attempts and completed suicides. Information on 
      suicidal behavior from Pakistan, a conservative South Asian Islamic country, is 
      lacking. To address the issue, a pilot study was carried out to assess the 
      prevalence of suicidal ideation in Pakistani college students. Suicidal ideation was 
      assessed on the basis of responses to four questions contained in the depression 
      subscale of the General Health Questionnaire-28. Of the total 217 completed 
      questionnaires, the overall rate of suicidal ideation was 31.4%. While there was no 
      significant difference between genders, more females (33%) than males (29.2%) 
      responded positively. Respondents belonging to single parent families and those 
      living at home, compared to those using hostel facilities, reported higher rates. 
      The reported rate in our sample is higher than similar studies conducted elsewhere. 
      There is the need for more information in this important area of suicidal behavior, 
      including studying such feelings in school going children as well as in a larger 
      community sample. The findings of such studies can contribute to our understanding 
      of the suicidal process in the Pakistani population and to address it at various 
      levels.

TI  - Physicians' Migration: Perceptions of Pakistani Medical Students.
PG  - 696-701
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the perceptions of medical students about factors responsible 
      for physicians'migration. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PLACE AND DURATION 
      OF STUDY: Dow Medical College and Civil Hospital, Karachi, from April to May 2015. 
      METHODOLOGY: Aself-administered structured questionnaire was used including 
      demographic details, attitudes about push and pull factors of migration, and reasons 
      for migrating or not migrating abroad. Final year students and interns were 
      included. Likert scale from 1 to 4 (1=strongly disagree to 4=strongly agree) was 
      used to assess attitudes. Data was analyzed by SPSS version 16. RESULTS: Atotal of 
      240 medical students, mostly females (n=181, 75%) (60% final year and 40% interns), 
      participated in the study. Majority wished to go abroad (n=127; 54%) with United 
      States being the favourite destination (n=80; 66.1%) and internal medicine fields 
      being the preferred choice for specialization (n=126; 54%). The major pull factors 
      were better quality of postgraduate education abroad (n=110; 48.2%) and economic 
      prospects (80; 35.2%); while the push factors were a weak healthcare system (n=219; 
      94.3%), inadequate salary structure (n=205; 88.3%), insecurity (n=219; 93.9%) and 
      increasing religious intolerance in Pakistan (n=183; 78.5%). CONCLUSION: This survey 
      highlights the continuing trend of physician migration from Pakistan owing to an 
      interplay of various push and pull factors. Majority of our medical students wish to 
      migrate, mainly due to low salaries, poor job structure, and insecurity. Urgent 
      interventions are required to reverse this trend of medical brain-drain.

AB  - Despite growing concerns over pathological internet usage, studies based on 
      validated psychometric instruments are still lacking in Pakistan. This study aimed 
      to examine the psychometric properties of the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) in a 
      sample of Pakistani students. A total of 522 students of medicine and dentistry 
      completed the questionnaire, which consisted of four sections: (a) demographics, (b) 
      number of hours spent on the Internet per day, (c) English version of the IAT, and 
      (d) the Defense Style Questionnaire-40. Maximum likelihood analysis and principal 
      axis factoring were used to validate the factor structure of the IAT. Convergent and 
      criterion validity were assessed by correlating IAT scores with number of hours 
      spent online and defense styles. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis 
      reflected the goodness of fit of a unidimensional structure of the IAT, with a high 
      alpha coefficient. The IAT had good face and convergent validity and no floor and 
      ceiling effects, and was judged easy to read by participants.

AB  - The complexity of the health care environment is increasing with the explosion of 
      technology, coupled with the issues of patients' access, equity, time efficiency, 
      and cost containment. Nursing education must focus on means that enable students to 
      develop the processes of active learning, problem-solving, and critical thinking, in 
      order to enable them to deal with the complexities. This study aims at identifying 
      the nursing students' perceptions about the effectiveness of utilized teaching and 
      learning strategies of clinical education, in improving students' knowledge, skills, 
      and attitudes. A descriptive cross sectional study design was utilized using both 
      qualitative and quantitative approaches. Data were collected from 74 students, using 
      a questionnaire that was developed for the purpose of the study and analyzed using 
      descriptive and non-parametric statistics. The findings revealed that demonstration 
      was the most effective strategy for improving students' skills; reflection, for 
      improving attitudes; and problem based learning and concept map for improving their 
      knowledge. Students' responses to open-ended questions confirmed the effectiveness 
      of these strategies in improving their learning outcomes. Recommendations have been 
      provided based on the findings.

TI  - Empathy, Experience and Cultural Beliefs Determine the Attitudes Towards Depression 
      Among Pakistani Medical Students.
PG  - 65-74
LID - 10.1007/s10597-019-00459-9 [doi]
AB  - The educated echelons of the Pakistani society as well as the medical fraternity 
      have consistently reported poor knowledge of mental illnesses in past surveys. This 
      poor knowledge further translates into poorer attitudes toward psychiatric patients 
      in Pakistani hospitals. However, a paucity of data on predictors of attitude toward 
      depression among Pakistani medical students, warrants further in depth 
      investigations. This cross-sectional study was conducted in two medical colleges in 
      the province of Punjab, Pakistan from January to July 2017. The data were collected 
      conveniently, using a self-administered questionnaire comprising of five parts: (a) 
      demographics, (b) a dichotomous (yes/no) scale exploring biological, psychosocial 
      and religio-magical beliefs about causation of depression, (c) a dichotomous scale 
      (yes/no) assessing knowledge regarding symptomatology of depression, (d) the revised 
      depression attitude questionnaire, (e) Toronto empathy questionnaire. There were a 
      total of 674 respondents. Students with an A-levels/high school diploma, urban 
      background, and aspiration for a career in psychiatry, high empathy levels and 
      endorsement of typical and atypical symptoms of psychiatry had more positive 
      attitudes towards depression. Negative attitudes toward depression were associated 
      with belief in religio-magical causes and false symptoms of depression. Attitude 
      toward depression among Pakistani medical students are shaped by several modifiable 
      and non-modifiable factors. Modifiable factors including exposure toward mentally 
      ill patients and knowledge of depression can be mitigated by in-depth clerkship 
      training in psychiatry.

TI  - Comparison of the perceived relevance of oral biology reported by students and 
      interns of a Pakistani dental college.
PG  - 203-6
LID - 10.1111/eje.12086 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyse and compare the perceived 
      relevance of oral biology with dentistry as reported by dental students and interns 
      and to investigate the most popular teaching approach and learning resource. 
      METHODS: A questionnaire aiming to ask about the relevance of oral biology to 
      dentistry, most popular teaching method and learning resource was utilised in this 
      study. Study groups encompassed second-year dental students who had completed their 
      course and dental interns. The data were obtained and analysed statistically. 
      RESULTS: The overall response rate for both groups was 60%. Both groups reported 
      high relevance of oral biology to dentistry. Perception of dental interns regarding 
      the relevance of oral biology to dentistry was higher than that of students. Both 
      groups identified student presentations as the most important teaching method. 
      Amongst the most important learning resources, textbooks were considered most 
      imperative by interns, whereas lecture handouts received the highest importance 
      score by students. CONCLUSIONS: Dental students and interns considered oral biology 
      to be relevant to dentistry, although greater relevance was reported by interns. 
      Year-wise advancement in dental education and training improves the perception of 
      the students about the relevance of oral biology to dentistry.

      using a small sample of students of all categories and classes of a medical college. 
      RESULTS: A total of 264 students out of 300 (88%) filled in the questionnaire. 
      Inability to cope, helplessness, increased psychological pressure, mental tension 
      and too much workload are 'stress factors' for students. A considerable majority (> 
      90%) think that they have been stressed at one time or another. Ninety-four per cent 
      of males have experienced stress. The senior students of the fourth and final year 
      feel more stressed (95% and 98% respectively). Low moods, inability to concentrate, 
      loss of temper are most common symptoms. Females report more symptoms. Academics and 
      exams are the most powerful stressors. Sports, music, hanging out with friends, 
      sleeping or going into isolation are various coping mechanisms. Stress can affect 
      the academic performance. If needed, students prefer to talk to a peer. They demand 
      more recreational activities on campus, revised schedule of academics and exams, 
      better counselling facilities and improvement in student-teacher relationship. 
      CONCLUSION: The prevalence of perceived stress seems to be high among medical 
      students, which tends to affect not only their academic performances but also all 
      aspects of health. Review of academics and exam schedules, more leisure time 
      activities, better interaction with the faculty and proper guidance, advisory 
      services and peer counselling at the campus could do a lot to reduce the stress.

TI  - Is Pakistan prepared for the COVID-19 epidemic? A questionnaire-based survey.
PG  - 824-832
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25814 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 is a pandemic that began in China in December 2019. World health 
      organization (WHO) has expressed fears that Pakistan might emerge as the next 
      epicenter of this pandemic. We hypothesize that at present the Pakistani masses are 
      not prepared to face any threat of a looming epidemic. The main aim of this study 
      was to evaluate the basic knowledge of educational and health care workers (HCWs) 
      regarding COVID-19, its control, and prevention. Knowledge about origin, symptoms, 
      and spread of viral infection was assessed. In this cross-sectional survey, a 
      self-designed questionnaire was distributed among 302 HCWs including physicians 
      (10.9%), nurses (1.32%), lab staff (1.65%), and academic individuals including 
      faculty and students (86.42%) of different organizations. Results were analyzed 
      using the χ(2) test. Obtained results validate our null hypothesis that Pakistani 
      masses are not well aware of the COVID-19 and strategies for the prevention and 
      control of infection. The study concluded that individuals belonging to the 
      front-line workers and high literacy groups are not prepared for the alarming 
      situation in the country. Effectual implementation of infection control programs 
      should be practiced, and it depends on awareness, training, and cooperation of 
      individuals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore lay understanding and perceptions of schizophrenia in 
      university students. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and 
      thematic analysis. SETTING: The University of Birmingham, West Midlands. 
      PARTICIPANTS: 20 UK home students of white British (n=5), Indian (n=5), Pakistani 
      (n=5), African Caribbean (n=4) and dual white British and African Caribbean 
      ethnicity (n=1). RESULTS: Findings revealed a lack of knowledge about schizophrenia, 
      particularly the negative symptoms that were not mentioned. There were mixed ideas 
      on the causes and sources of available help for schizophrenia; however, positively 
      many said they would consult their general practitioner. While there was a general 
      misconception among the students that schizophrenia caused multiple personalities 
      and was a dangerous illness, there were some differences in perceptions and 
      understanding between ethnic groups, with more Indian students perceiving upbringing 
      as a causal factor in the development of the illness and more Pakistani students 
      perceiving possession by a spirit as a cause. CONCLUSIONS: The university students 
      interviewed lacked knowledge about schizophrenia and stigma was widespread, both of 
      which may delay help-seeking. Public health campaigns educating young people about 
      schizophrenia are required to improve early identification and intervention and 
      improve outcomes. Further research exploring ways to effectively tackle stigma is 
      also required.

PG  - 852-856
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the health-related physical fitness status of students and the 
      attributes of performance in terms of endurance and power. METHODS: The 
      cross-sectional study was conducted at University of Sindh, Jamshoro, Pakistan, and 
      Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, during academic session of January 2012 to 
      December 2013, and comprised an equal number of male and female students aged 18-23 
      years. Prior to the assessment, physical activity readiness questionnaire was filled 
      by all the subjects, while standardised health-related physical fitness criterion 
      was used to make comparisons in terms of oxygen consumption. . RESULTS: There were 
      600 subjects in all; 300(50%) at each of the two centres, and at both centres, there 
      were 150(25%) boys and 150(25%) girls. Both for power and endurance, mean values of 
      Chinese students were significantly better than their Pakistani counterparts 
      (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Chinese students had better health-related physical fitness 
      levels than Pakistani students of either gender.

TI  - University students perspective on polio vaccination--ruse or realistic need for 
      Pakistani children?
PG  - 694-6
AB  - Polio vaccinators and law enforcement officials protecting them, have been killed in 
      the line of duty since 2012 in Pakistan. This study was conducted to determine the 
      opinions of university students in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, regarding the 
      importance of polio vaccination, and the role of international donor agencies. Nine 
      hundred forty-six students participated in this study; 833 (88.1%) students thought 
      that polio is a public health problem in the country, and 815 (86.2%) thought that 
      polio vaccination prevents polio in children. About a quarter of respondents thought 
      that Pakistanis as well as non-Pakistanis working for either international 
      nongovernmental organizations or United Nations agencies are spies working for the 
      Western governments or their spy agencies. An appalling 300 (31.7%) respondents 
      replied as either affirmatively or 'don't know' to the question whether killing of 
      polio vaccinators is justified.

      University Students.
PG  - 2086-98
LID - 10.1007/s10943-016-0263-2 [doi]
AB  - Pakistani Muslim university students (N = 207) displayed Personal Distress, Public 
      Distress, and Personal Defeat Reactions to Terrorism. All three reactions predicted 
      poorer mental health with Personal Defeat being especially disturbed in its 
      adjustment implications. In line with the assumptions of coping theory, scores on 
      the Negative Religious Coping Scale correlated positively with Personal Distress and 
      with Personal Defeat. However, Positive Religious Coping, the spirituality of Muslim 
      Experiential Religiousness, and the Intrinsic and Extrinsic Personal Religious 
      Orientations exhibited positive rather than the expected negative linkages with 
      Personal Distress and Public Distress. Muslim Experiential Religiousness moderated 
      associations of Positive and Negative Religious Coping with Public Distress. When 
      spirituality was high, these relationships were negative. When spirituality was low, 
      they became positive. These data documented the negative impacts that terrorism can 
      have on Pakistanis and suggested that Muslim religious commitments may have an 
      important role to play in resisting those influences.

TI  - Perceptions of Pakistani medical students about drugs and alcohol: a 
      questionnaire-based survey.
PG  - 31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug abuse is hazardous and known to be prevalent among young adults, 
      warranting efforts to increase awareness about harmful effects and to change 
      attitudes. This study was conducted to assess the perceptions of a group of medical 
      students from Pakistan, a predominantly Muslim country, regarding four drugs namely 
      heroin, charas, benzodiazepines and alcohol. RESULTS: In total, 174 self-reported 
      questionnaires were received (87% response rate). The most commonly cited reasons 
      for why some students take these drugs were peer pressure (96%), academic stress 
      (90%) and curiosity (88%). The most commonly cited justifiable reason was to go to 
      sleep (34%). According to 77%, living in the college male hostel predisposed one to 
      using these drugs. Sixty percent of students said that the drugs did not improve 
      exam performance, while 54% said they alleviated stress. Seventy-eight percent said 
      they did not intend to ever take drugs in the future. Females and day-scholars were 
      more willing to discourage a friend who took drugs. Morality (78%), religion (76%) 
      and harmful effects of drugs (57%) were the most common deterrents against drug 
      intake. Five suggestions to decrease drug abuse included better counseling 
      facilities (78%) and more recreational facilities (60%). CONCLUSION: Efforts need to 
      be made to increase student awareness regarding effects and side effects of drugs. 
      Our findings suggest that educating students about the adverse effects as well as 
      the moral and religious implications of drug abuse is more likely to have a positive 
      impact than increased policing. Proper student-counseling facilities and healthier 
      avenues for recreation are also required.

TI  - Opinion of Pakistani physiotherapists/students about anatomy as a subject and method 
      of teaching anatomy: a cross sectional survey.
PG  - 153-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To recognise and identify the importance of Anatomy as a subject for 
      physiotherapists/students. METHODS: The cross-sectional descriptive study was 
      conducted from January to October 2011 at Riphah International University, Lahore, 
      and comprised physiotherapists registered with Pakistan Physical Therapy Association 
      and students pursuing undergraduate physiotherapy studies at the University. A 
      survey proforma consisting of six questions was used for data collection which was 
      analysed using SPSS 17. RESULTS: Of the 500 questionnaires distributed among 
      physiotherapists and students, 286(57.2%) were collected back duly filled. Overall, 
      280(97.9%) respondents said Anatomy was important in physical therapy, 179(62.58%) 
      said Anatomy was a difficult subject to retain knowledge of, 155 (54.38%) were of 
      the view that only Clinical Anatomy should be studied, 204 (71.32%) were in favour 
      of performing dissection, 259 (90.55%) found that teaching videos were essential for 
      the study of Anatomy, and 89 (31.11%) believed Anatomy could be memorised by 
      multiple readings. CONCLUSION: Despite being a difficult subject, Anatomy is an 
      essential subject for medical professionals.

TI  - A cross-cultural comparison of British and Pakistani medical students' understanding 
      of schizophrenia.
PG  - 308-19
LID - 10.1016/j.psychres.2007.08.019 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to compare British, British Pakistani and Native Pakistani (from 
      Pakistan) medical students' beliefs about the manifestation, causes and cures of 
      schizophrenia, prior to any psychiatric training. A total of 305 participants 
      completed a questionnaire on general beliefs about people with schizophrenia, causal 
      explanations concerning the aetiology of schizophrenia and the role of hospitals and 
      society in treating people with schizophrenia. It was predicted that compared with 
      the British and British Pakistanis, the Pakistanis would have more negative beliefs 
      and attitudes, considering people with schizophrenia to be more dangerous and 
      unpredictable; they were also expected to use more superstitious beliefs to explain 
      the cause of schizophrenia and its symptoms; as well as believe more in seeking help 
      from God and faith healers. There was strong evidence to suggest that Pakistanis 
      possessed more negative beliefs and attitudes about people with schizophrenia, but 
      there was no evidence to indicate that Pakistanis believed more in superstitious 
      causal explanations. Pakistanis were more likely to consider seeking help from faith 
      healers, but not God, compared with British Pakistanis and the British. Results 
      confirm previous European-Asian difference in the understanding of the cause, 
      manifestation and cure of schizophrenia. The impact of traditional and Western 
      cultural influences on British Pakistanis is considered.

TI  - Development of Growth Charts of Pakistani Children Aged 4-15 Years Using Quantile 
      Regression: A Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - e2138
LID - 10.7759/cureus.2138 [doi]
LID - e2138
AB  - Background Growth charts are essential tools used by pediatricians as well as public 
      health researchers in assessing and monitoring the well-being of pediatric 
      populations. Development of these growth charts, especially for children above five 
      years of age, is challenging and requires current anthropometric data and advanced 
      statistical analysis. These growth charts are generally presented as a series of 
      smooth centile curves. A number of modeling approaches are available for generating 
      growth charts and applying these on national datasets is important for generating 
      country-specific reference growth charts. Objective To demonstrate that quantile 
      regression (QR) as a viable statistical approach to construct growth reference 
      charts and to assess the applicability of the World Health Organization (WHO) 2007 
      growth standards to a large Pakistani population of school-going children. 
      Methodology This is a secondary data analysis using anthropometric data of 9,515 
      students from a Pakistani survey conducted between 2007 and 2014 in four cities of 
      Pakistan. Growth reference charts were created using QR as well as the LMS (Box-Cox 
      transformation (L), the median (M), and the generalized coefficient of variation 
      (S)) method and then compared with WHO 2007 growth standards. Results Centile values 
      estimated by the LMS method and QR procedure had few differences. The centile values 
      attained from QR procedure of BMI-for-age, weight-for-age, and height-for-age of 
      Pakistani children were lower than the standard WHO 2007 centile. Conclusion QR 
      should be considered as an alternative method to develop growth charts for its 
      simplicity and lack of necessity to transform data. WHO 2007 standards are not 
      suitable for Pakistani children.

TI  - Differences in Empathy Levels of Medical Students Based on Gender, Year of Medical 
      School and Career Choice.
PG  - 310-313
LID - 10.29271/jcpsp.2018.04.310 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure mean empathy scores of Pakistani medical students and to 
      explore any association of empathy scores with gender, medical school year and 
      future career choice. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PLACE AND DURATION OF 
      STUDY: Shifa College of Medicine, Shifa Tameer-e-Millat University, during the 
      academic year 2015-2016. METHODOLOGY: The student version of Jefferson Scale of 
      Physician Empathy (JSPE) was distributed to the students electronically via the 
      student portal. Response that were completed in full were included in the study. 
      Descriptive statistics was used to analyse student demographic data. The student 
      score on the JSPE was reported as the mean (out of 7) of each item. Independent 
      samples t-test was employed to check the significant differences between genders. 
      Empathy score with advancing year of study was investigated using ANOVA. ANOVA with 
      post-hoc Tukey's test was used to study the relationship between career choice and 
      empathy score. RESULTS: The response rate was 70.94%. The mean score was 4.51 ±0.69. 
      Females obtained greater, but statistically insignificant (p=0.08) empathy score 
      (4.58) as compared to the male students (4.45). No statistically significant 
      difference was seen between scores on the survey across the five academic years 
      (F=0.88, p=0.47). Students who selected medicine and allied as career choice showed 
      a significantly higher empathy score than those who opted for surgery. The internal 
      consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.78. CONCLUSION: There were low 
      levels of empathy in Pakistani medical students. Students with interest in medicine 
      and allied showed higher empathy scores compared to surgical or technical 
      specialties. No association of empathy scores with gender and medical school year 
      was observed.

TI  - Attitudes of pakistani medical students towards psychiatry as a prospective career: 
      a survey.
PG  - 160-4
LID - 10.1176/appi.ap.32.2.160 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pakistan is facing a shortage of psychiatrists; there are about 350 
      psychiatrists in a country of 150 million. Medical specialty choice surveys of 
      medical students have approached this issue from various angles. The authors' 
      objective is to explore the attitudes of Pakistani medical students toward 
      psychiatry as their future career. METHODS: Third-year medical students from four 
      medical colleges in different regions of Pakistan participated. A questionnaire was 
      hand distributed and collected in each medical college by a contact person who was 
      not affiliated with the department of psychiatry in any of the medical colleges 
      included in the survey. RESULTS: The response rate was 60% out of a sample of 381 
      students. The mean age was 21 years, and 57% were female. The majority (98.4%) were 
      Muslims. Respondents were similar in all demographic characteristics except 
      household income. Only 7.6% reported psychiatry to be either their chosen career or 
      a highly likely choice. A Friedman test found a significant difference in mean 
      scores of ratings of the attractiveness of various career aspects of different 
      specialties. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively small numbers of students identified psychiatry 
      as their specialty of choice. This trend is similar to many other studies. Given the 
      small number of practicing psychiatrists in Pakistan, this finding is not very 
      encouraging.

      individuals.
PG  - 431

LID - 431
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unhealthy behaviors are associated with mental health problems and 
      violence in adolescents, yet their combined association has been understudied. Using 
      the Global School Health Survey, this study examined the association between 
      combined unhealthy behaviors (including fast food, soft drink, smoking, other 
      tobacco products and physical inactivity) and anxiety, suicidal ideation and 
      involvement in physical fight among Pakistani adolescents. METHODS: Data were 
      obtained from the Global School Health Survey conducted in Pakistan (2009). The 
      study population consisted of school going adolescents aged 13 to 15 years. 
      Association of combined unhealthy behaviors with anxiety, suicidal ideation and 
      involvement in physical fight were studied through secondary analysis. We used 
      univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis by complex sample method, 
      accounting for cluster sampling technique used for data collection. RESULTS: Of the 
      total 4583 students, weighted percentage and unweighted count for one, two, three 
      and four or more unhealthy behaviors was 39.4% (n = 1770), 22.1% (n = 963), 5.9% 
      (n = 274) and 1.2% (n = 62) respectively. The weighted prevalence for anxiety, 
      suicidal ideation and involvement in physical fight were 8.4%, 7.3% and 37.4% 
      respectively. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis after 
      adjustment showed that students who had four or more unhealthy behaviors had higher 
      odds of; being anxious (OR 2.45, 95%CI 1.31-4.59, p value 0.004), suicide ideation 
      (OR 4.56, 95%CI 2.58-8.07, p value <0.001) and being involved in physical fight (OR 
      3.15, 95% CI 1.63-6.08, p value <0.001) as compared to those who had not adopted any 
      unhealthy behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the co-occurrence of 
      unhealthy behaviors is associated with anxiety, suicidal ideation and physical fight 
      among adolescents. These findings should be considered when developing interventions 
      to combat detrimental outcomes of unhealthy behaviors during adolescence.

      developing countries--a systematic review.
PG  - 281

AB  - BACKGROUND: Out of pocket payments are the predominant method of financing 
      healthcare in many developing countries, which can result in impoverishment and 
      financial catastrophe for those affected. In 2010, WHO estimated that approximately 
      100 million people are pushed below the poverty line each year by payments for 
      healthcare. Micro health insurance (MHI) has been used in some countries as means of 
      risk pooling and reducing out of pocket health expenditure. A systematic review was 
      conducted to assess the extent to which MHI has contributed to providing financial 
      risk protection to low-income households in developing countries, and suggest how 
      the findings can be applied in the Pakistani setting. METHODS: We conducted a 
      systematic search for published literature using the search terms "Community based 
      health insurance AND developing countries", "Micro health insurance AND developing 
      countries", "Mutual health insurance AND developing countries", "mutual OR micro OR 
      community based health insurance" "Health insurance AND impact AND poor" "Health 
      insurance AND financial protection" and "mutual health organizations" on three 
      databases, Pubmed, Google Scholar and Science Direct (Elsevier). Only those records 
      that were published in the last ten years, in English language with their full texts 
      available free of cost, were considered for inclusion in this review. Hand searching 
      was carried out on the reference lists of the retrieved articles and webpages of 
      international organizations like World Bank, World Health Organization and 
      International Labour Organization. RESULTS: Twenty-three articles were eligible for 
      inclusion in this systematic review (14 from Asia and 9 from Africa). Our analysis 
      shows that MHI, in the majority of cases, has been found to contribute to the 
      financial protection of its beneficiaries, by reducing out of pocket health 
      expenditure, catastrophic health expenditure, total health expenditure, household 
      borrowings and poverty. MHI also had a positive safeguarding effect on household 
      savings, assets and consumption patterns. CONCLUSION: Our review suggests that MHI, 
      targeted at the low-income households and tailored to suit the cultural and 
      geographical structures in the various areas of Pakistan, may contribute towards 
      providing protection to the households from catastrophe and impoverishment resulting 
      from health expenditures. This paper emphasizes the need for further research to 
      fill the knowledge gap that exists about the impact of MHI, using robust study 
      designs and impact indicators.

TI  - Knowledge, attitude and preventive practices related to COVID-19: a cross-sectional 
      study in two Pakistani university populations.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1007/s40267-020-00737-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess COVID-19-related knowledge, 
      attitudes, and preventive practices of two Pakistani university populations. 
      METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among students and employees of two 
      higher education institutions in Lahore, Pakistan, namely the University of Lahore 
      and the Gulab Devi Educational Complex. Participants were recruited using a 
      convenient sampling method. A validated 45-item, self-administered questionnaire was 
      used to collect data. Total possible scores were 0-14 for knowledge (scores < 7, 
      7-10 and > 10 were considered to indicate poor, moderate and good knowledge, 
      respectively); 0-7 for attitude (scores > 5 were considered to indicate a good 
      attitude); and 0-18 for COVID-19 preventative practices (scores > 12 were considered 
      to indicate good preventative practices). RESULTS: Of the 417 enrolled participants, 
      416 reported that they were aware of COVID-19 and social media was the major source 
      of their information. Mean scores were 10.12 ± 2.20 for knowledge (good, moderate 
      and poor knowledge in 50.2%, 42.8% and 7.0% of participants, respectively); 
      5.74 ± 1.28 for attitude (65.4% of individuals had a positive attitude); and 
      11.04 ± 3.34 for COVID-19 preventative practices (only 36.5% of participants had 
      good preventive practices). CONCLUSION: Pakistani university students and employees 
      have good knowledge and attitudes regarding COVID-19, but unsatisfactory preventive 
      practices. Therefore, health regulators should use multiple communication 
      approaches, such as electronic, print and social media, phone messages, etc., to 
      increase awareness and improve practices related to COVID-19.

TI  - The importance of Evolutionary Medicine in developing countries: A case for 
      Pakistan's medical schools.
PG  - 26-33
LID - 10.1093/emph/eoy004 [doi]
AB  - Evolutionary Medicine (EM) is a fundamental science exploring why our bodies are 
      plagued with disease and hindered by limitations. EM views the body as an assortment 
      of benefits, mistakes, and compromises molded over millennia. It highlights the role 
      of evolution in numerous diseases encountered in community and family medicine 
      clinics of developing countries. It enables us to ask informed questions and develop 
      novel responses to global health problems. An understanding of the field is thus 
      crucial for budding doctors, but its study is currently limited to a handful of 
      medical schools in high-income countries. For the developing world, Pakistan's 
      medical schools may be excellent starting posts as the country is beset with 
      communicable and non-communicable diseases that are shaped by evolution. Remarkably, 
      Pakistani medical students are open to studying and incorporating EM into their 
      training. Understanding the principles of EM could empower them to tackle growing 
      health problems in the country. Additionally, some difficulties that western medical 
      schools face in integrating EM into their curriculum may not be a hindrance in 
      Pakistan. We propose solutions for the remaining challenges, including obstinate 
      religious sentiments. Herein, we make the case that incorporating EM is particularly 
      important in developing countries such as Pakistan and that it is achievable in its 
      medical student body.

TI  - Use of smokeless tobacco among groups of Pakistani medical students - a cross 
      sectional study.
PG  - 231
AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of smokeless tobacco is common in South Asia. Tobacco is a major 
      preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Doctors make one of the best avenues 
      to influence patients' tobacco use. However, medical students addicted to tobacco 
      are likely to retain this habit as physicians and are unlikely to counsel patients 
      against using tobacco. With this background, this study was conducted with the 
      objective of determining the prevalence of smokeless tobacco among Pakistani medical 
      students. METHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out in three medical colleges 
      of Pakistan - one from the north and two from the southern region. 1025 students 
      selected by convenient sampling completed a peer reviewed, pre-tested, 
      self-administered questionnaire. Questions were asked regarding lifetime use (at 
      least once or twice in their life), current use (at least once is the last 30 days), 
      and established use (more than 100 times in their life) of smokeless tobacco. Chi 
      square and logistic regression analyses were used. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty 
      (21.5%) students had used tobacco in some form (smoked or smokeless) in their 
      lifetime. Sixty six (6.4%) students were lifetime users of smokeless tobacco. 
      Thirteen (1.3%) were daily users while 18 (1.8%) fulfilled the criterion for 
      established users. Niswar was the most commonly used form of smokeless tobacco 
      followed by paan and nass. Most naswar users belonged to NWFP while most paan users 
      studied in Karachi. On univariate analysis, lifetime use of smokeless tobacco showed 
      significant associations with the use of cigarettes, student gender (M > F), student 
      residence (boarders > day scholars) and location of the College (NWFP > Karachi). 
      Multivariate analysis showed independent association of lifetime use of smokeless 
      tobacco with concomitant cigarette smoking, student gender and location of the 
      medical college. CONCLUSION: The use of smokeless tobacco among medical students 
      cannot be ignored. The governments should add the goal of eliminating smokeless 
      tobacco to existing drives against cigarette smoking. Drives in Karachi should focus 
      more on eliminating paan usage while those in NWFP should focus more on the use of 
      naswar. Medical colleges should provide greater education about the myths and 
      hazards of smokeless tobacco.

TI  - Gender differences on medical students' attitudes toward patient-centred care: a 
      cross-sectional survey conducted in Heilongjiang, China.
PG  - e7896
LID - 10.7717/peerj.7896 [doi]
LID - e7896
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Assessing medical students' attitudes toward patient-centred care is 
      essential to bettering medical education. Based on doctor-patient relationships and 
      the medical system in China, it is important to explore the impact of gender 
      differences and other background factors on patient-centred attitudes and to provide 
      references for medical education reform. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was 
      conducted on fourth-year medical undergraduate students from November 2017 to March 
      2018 in Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China. The Chinese-revised 
      Patient-Practitioner Orientation Scale (CR-PPOS), which has been validated in 
      previous research, was used to measure the medical students' attitudes. The medical 
      students' demographic data was collected, including their gender, age, information 
      on whether they have siblings, family residence location, doctor(s) for parents, 
      year in which the student first experienced clinical practice, and student category. 
      RESULTS: A total of 513 students (91.12%) completed the survey. The Chinese medical 
      students scored considerably higher for 'Caring' (including patients' preferences 
      into the decision-making process) than for 'Sharing' (sharing 
      information/responsibility with patients). These students tended to have 
      patient-centred attitudes, as measured by an average overall CR-PPOS score of 3.63 
      (scores higher than 3.5 indicate patient-centred attitudes), which is higher than 
      Malian (3.38) and Pakistani (3.40) medical students but lower than American (4.57) 
      and Brazilian (4.66) students. Female students (P < 0.05) were significantly 
      associated with more patient-centred attitudes and with higher 'Sharing' and 
      'Caring' subscale scores. Student category (P < 0.05) was associated with 'Sharing' 
      and 'Caring' scores. Clinical hospital students (P < 0.05) were associated with more 
      patient-centred attitudes and with higher 'Sharing' and 'Caring' subscale scores, 
      Students without siblings (p < 0.07) were associated with the higher 'Sharing' 
      subscale scores. CONCLUSIONS: In China, gender has a significant impact on medical 
      students' patient-centred attitudes, which is similar to findings from other 
      countries. If medical schools want to raise patient-centred attitudes across the 
      board and bridge the gap between male and female patient-centred attitudes, gender, 
      student category, and other factors should be incorporated into medical education.

TI  - Assessment of knowledge about evidence based medicine in medical students and 
      doctors in a Pakistani health care setting.
PG  - 126-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence based practice promotes self assessment and ensures delivery of 
      up to date care to patients. The concept of Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) in 
      developing countries is still in its infancy where strong opinions drive patient 
      care. METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional survey to explore the knowledge, 
      perceptions and attitudes regarding EBM in final year medical students and 
      physicians of our institution. The survey was distributed to all students and 
      residents of the college and the affiliated hospital. RESULTS: The response rate was 
      57% (74/130). Seventy-one percent (53/74) of respondents were not aware of EBM. Out 
      of these, 38 were medical students and 15 were house officers. Only 16 (9 students 
      and 7 doctors) admitted that they had heard about EBM. Those who heard about EBM 
      recognised its importance in patient care. Teaching at both under- and postgraduate 
      level was strongly suggested. Participants recognised the need for EBM skills and 
      expertise. Financial constraint was considered as the main hindrance in practicing 
      EBM. CONCLUSION: The concept of EBM is still alien to most of the students and 
      residents at our institution. There is need for incorporating formal teaching of EBM 
      at all levels of medical education.

TI  - Building Support for Adolescent Sexuality and Reproductive Health Education and 
      Responding to Resistance in Conservative Contexts: Cases From Pakistan.
PG  - 128-136
LID - 10.9745/GHSP-D-17-00285 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite international recommendations and supportive evidence, there are 
      few examples of scaled-up and sustained programs to provide adolescents with 
      sexuality education. Moreover, despite acknowledgment that building community 
      support and responding to resistance are key challenges, there is a lack of detailed 
      discussion on specific programmatic strategies to address these issues. OBJECTIVES: 
      This article reviews the work of 2 organizations-Aahung and Rutgers Pakistan-that 
      are successfully implementing large-scale sexuality education programs in Pakistan, 
      collectively reaching more than 500,000 students. This review aims to answer the 
      following questions: (1) How did Aahung and Rutgers Pakistan work to understand 
      Pakistani society and culture and shape their programs to build community support? 
      (2) How did Aahung and Rutgers Pakistan overcome resistance to their efforts? 
      METHODS: We reviewed program documents and publications, synthesized key themes, 
      identified questions of interest, and engaged key informants from Aahung and Rutgers 
      Pakistan's leadership. RESULTS: The success of Aahung and Rutgers Pakistan was 
      grounded in their readiness to understand the nuanced context within the 
      communities, collaborate with groups of stakeholders-including parents, school 
      officials, religious leaders, media personnel, and adolescents themselves-to ensure 
      support, and stand up to forces of resistance to pursue their goals. Specific 
      strategies included working with communities to select content, tactfully selecting 
      and framing issues with careful consideration for sensitivities, engaging 
      adolescents' influencers, strengthening media presence, showcasing school programs 
      to increase understanding and transparency, and choosing opportune times to 
      introduce messages. CONCLUSION: The successful strategies used by Aahung and Rutgers 
      Pakistan to promote adolescent sexual and reproductive health through sexuality 
      education can inform programs worldwide. Additionally, the programmatic weaknesses 
      identified can guide future planning and action by Aahung and Rutgers Pakistan. We 
      call on other programs to continue sharing challenges, specifically related to 
      resistance, with sexuality education programs in order to develop a toolbox of 
      additional strategies for community uptake.

TI  - The factors that influence attitudes toward organ donation for transplantation among 
      UK university students of Indian and Pakistani descent.
PG  - 359-67
LID - 10.1111/ctr.12096 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The shortage of organs donated for transplantation is particularly 
      severe among ethnic minorities. Previous work has often studied ethnic minorities in 
      broad groups, failing to differentiate by age or country of education. We 
      investigated the younger generation of UK-educated ethnically Indian and Pakistani 
      students to determine their attitudes toward organ donation. METHODS: We conducted 
      nine focus groups and eight semi-structured interviews. Participants were divided by 
      ethnicity, gender, and medical/non-medical background. Interview transcripts were 
      analyzed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: Six key factors influencing attitudes toward 
      organ donation were found: religion, awareness of the importance of donation, impact 
      of medical education, culture-specific factors, treatment of donors and their 
      organs, and influence of family. The attitude of Islam to donation was highly 
      relevant to Pakistani participants, more than other factors; for Indians, all six 
      factors were similarly relevant. We found that medical education specifically had an 
      important effect on shaping attitudes toward donation. Cultural changes suggested 
      the younger generation may differ from their elders as they adopt British culture. 
      Awareness of donation was universally low. CONCLUSIONS: Indian and Pakistani 
      students are hesitant to donate organs because of multiple factors, which if 
      addressed in a culturally relevant manner could substantially improve donation 
      rates.

TI  - Medical Students' Stress, Psychological Morbidity, and Coping Strategies: a 
      Cross-Sectional Study from Pakistan.
PG  - 92-6
LID - 10.1007/s40596-015-0413-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors studied the prevalence of psychological morbidity, sources 
      and severity of stresses, as well as coping strategies in Pakistani medical 
      students. METHODS: Medical students in Lahore, Pakistan, completed a 
      cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire in 2013 on the sources and severity 
      of various stressors. The General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and Brief COPE 
      assessed the psychological morbidity and coping strategies. RESULTS: Out of 1500 
      students, 527 responded to the survey. The prevalence of psychological morbidity was 
      23.3%; 52.3% respondents showed evidence of distress. By logistic regression 
      analysis, GHQ-12 caseness was associated with being male and occurrence of 
      health-related stressors. The most common stressors were related to academic 
      concerns. Coping strategies showed variation by GHQ-caseness. CONCLUSION: The 
      significant psychological morbidity and distress warrants establishing support 
      systems to support students and bringing about evidence-based changes to teaching 
      and evaluation systems. Adequate counseling facilities should be made available and 
      students encouraged to seek help.

TI  - Premenstrual Syndrome: Existence, Knowledge, and Attitude Among Female University 
      Students in Karachi.
PG  - e2290
LID - 10.7759/cureus.2290 [doi]
LID - e2290
AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the existence, knowledge, and the 
      attitude of female students towards premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Methods This 
      cross-sectional study was conducted in three universities in Karachi, Pakistan. A 
      total of 448 female students participated in the study. The clinical criterion of 
      American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) for PMS was used to 
      assess the prevalence of PMS in the participants. The questionnaire was set in four 
      parts, one each to assess the knowledge, the attitude, and practices regarding PMS 
      and one to assess the gap between self-perceived PMS and actual PMS. Data were 
      analyzed descriptively using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), 
      version 20 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY). Results The majority (96.4%) of female 
      students were aware of PMS, while only 19% females knew about premenstrual dysphoric 
      disorder. The self-reported prevalence of PMS was 79.5% and the prevalence using the 
      ACOG criteria was 23.9%. Common symptoms were irritability, angry outbursts, 
      depression, breast tenderness, and gastrointestinal problems. More than half (60.4%) 
      of the participants reported PMS disturbed their normal routine, while 81.5% 
      reported stress exacerbated their symptoms. The majority (77.5%) of women believed 
      PMS was a significant issue to be discussed but 49.4% did not take treatment for 
      their PMS. Conclusion There is a significant impact of PMS in the lives of Pakistani 
      women, and it is a common problem all over the globe. Despite the growing awareness, 
      there remains a considerable deficiency of knowledge about the necessity to consult 
      a doctor or seek treatment for their symptoms.

TI  - Prevalence of mistreatment or belittlement among medical students--a cross sectional 
      survey at a private medical school in Karachi, Pakistan.
PG  - e13429
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0013429 [doi]
LID - e13429
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mistreatment or belittlement of medical students either by faculty or 
      fellow students has often been reported. Perception of mistreatment has also been 
      associated with increased degree of psychological morbidity. There is a lack of such 
      studies being conducted amongst the medical students of Pakistan. The aim of this 
      study was to determine the prevalence and forms of perceived mistreatment and 
      presence of mental health morbidity in a private medical school in Pakistan. Also, 
      any association between mental health morbidity and mistreatment was to be 
      identified. METHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out on medical students 
      from Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan during the period of 
      June-September 2007. A self administered questionnaire, adapted from Frank et al and 
      Baldwin et al was distributed to a total of 350 students. The questionnaire 
      consisted of three parts: the first dealing with the demographics of the population, 
      the second concerning the various forms of mistreatment, while the third assessed 
      the mental health of students using the General Health Questionnaire 12(GHQ12). 
      Descriptive statistics were performed. The Chi-square test and Fisher's exact tests 
      were applied. RESULTS: A total of 350 students were approached out of which 232 
      completed the questionnaire giving a response rate of 66.2%. Mistreatment was 
      reported by 62.5% (145/232) of the respondents. Of these, 69.7% (83/145) were males 
      and 54.9% (62/145) were females. There was a significant relationship between 
      gender, year division, stress at medical school and possible use of drugs/alcohol 
      and reported mistreatment but no statistical relationship was seen with psychiatric 
      morbidity. The overall prevalence of psychological morbidity was 34.8% (77/221). 
      CONCLUSION: This study suggests high prevalence of perceived mistreatment and 
      psychological morbidity among Pakistani medical students. However, no association 
      was found between these two aspects of medical student education. There is a need to 
      bring about changes to make the medical education environment conducive to learning. 
      Increased student feedback, support systems and guidance about progress throughout 
      the year and the provision of adequate learning resources may provide help with 
      resolving both of these issues.

TI  - Does Religiosity Reduce Narcissistic Personality Disorder? Examining the Case of 
      Muslim University Students.
PG  - 1463-1470
LID - 10.1007/s10943-018-0628-9 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the influences of religiousness on the 
      prevalence of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) among young adults. Prevalence 
      of three forms of Allportian religious orientation, three forms of quest religious 
      orientation and seven symptoms of NPD were examined through self-reported measures. 
      618 randomly selected Muslim students from the four public sector Pakistani 
      universities participated in the study. Three research instruments comprising 
      Religious Orientation Scale developed by Gorsuch and McPherson, Quest Scale 
      developed by Batson and Schoenrade and Narcissistic Personality Inventory developed 
      by Raskin and Terry were used to collect the data. All subscales demonstrated more 
      than .70 Cronbach Alpha Coefficients. The findings demonstrate comparatively higher 
      presence of intrinsic, extrinsic personal and extrinsic social religious 
      orientations among the Pakistani Muslim young adults. The presence of NPD symptoms 
      remains higher among the participants too. The study concludes that the religious 
      orientations significantly explain the variances in the prevalence of NPD symptoms 
      among the Muslim university students with the direct effects of intrinsic and 
      extrinsic personal religious orientations and indirect effects of quest religious 
      orientations.

TI  - Complementary and Alternative Medicine: Perceptions of Medical Students from 
      Pakistan.
PG  - 4469
LID - 10.3402/meo.v12i.4469 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In view of the increasing popularity of complementary and alternative 
      medicine (CAM), it is imperative that medical students, the health professionals of 
      tomorrow, possess adequate knowledge on the topic. OBJECTIVES: This is a descriptive 
      study designed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and behavior of medical students 
      about CAM and to capture their perceptions and opinions about its integration into 
      the medical curriculum. METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was 
      done on 198 medical students selected randomly from a Pakistani medical college. 
      Associations between different variables were tested using the χ(2)-test of 
      significance. RESULTS: Among the 198 participants, a majority believed that some of 
      the CAM modalities are useful; they lacked knowledge, however, about their safety 
      and efficacy. Most of the students believed that it should be used in conjunction 
      with conventional medicine and that, if given adequate training, they would 
      incorporate it in their future medical practice. One-third of the respondents voted 
      in favor of incorporation of CAM into the medical curriculum. CONCLUSION: Despite 
      being aware of the usefulness of CAM only a few medical students had pursued further 
      knowledge. In order to prepare the medical students of today to better fulfill their 
      duties as tomorrow's physicians, consideration should be given to incorporating CAM 
      in the medical curriculum.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate psychological well-being and substance abuse among medical 
      students in Pakistan. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was 
      conducted in six medical colleges across Pakistan. Final-year medical students were 
      interviewed by either a postgraduate trainee in psychiatry or a consultant 
      psychiatrist. RESULTS: A total of 540 medical students were approached; 342 
      participated and the response rate was 64.5%. Mean age was 23.73 years (SD 2.45 
      years); 52.5% were male and 90% single. Two out of every five respondents reported 
      that work/study at medical school affected their personal health and well-being. A 
      considerable proportion of students were aware of alcohol and smoking as coping 
      strategies for stress in medical students. The main factors causing stress were 
      heavy workload (47.4%), relationship with colleagues (13.5%) and staff (11.9%). A 
      total of 30% reported a history of depression and 15% among them had used an 
      antidepressant. More than half were aware of depression in colleagues. The majority 
      of respondents said that teaching provided on substance misuse in the areas of 
      alcohol and illegal drugs, management/treatment of addiction, and models of 
      addiction was poor. There was significant association (p = 0.044) between stress and 
      awareness about alcohol as a coping strategy for stress among medical students. A 
      significant negative association was also found between medical colleges in public 
      sector (p = 0.052), female gender (p = 0.003) and well-being. CONCLUSION: The 
      majority of the medical students reported a negative impact of heavy workload on 
      their psychological well-being. Significant numbers of medical students think that 
      substance misuse is a coping strategy for stress. Teaching on addiction/addictive 
      substances is poor at undergraduate level in Pakistani medical colleges.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of Giardia lamblia in Pakistani children is currently 
      unknown. The aim here was to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of Giardia 
      lamblia in children exhibiting diarrhea. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study 
      at different district healthcare hospitals in Pakistan. METHODS: A total of 800 
      samples were collected from children aged 0-10 years. Information regarding personal 
      data, demographic data and supposed risk factors was collected through a structured 
      questionnaire. Giardia lamblia was detected through direct microscopy and antigens 
      through the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The prevalence of 
      Giardia lamblia was 2.75% through direct microscopy and inflated to 9.5% through 
      ELISA. The demographic factors positively associated with occurrences of giardiasis 
      were age (P = 0.035; odds ratio, OR = 1.96; 95% confidence interval, CI = 
      1.094-3.533), mother's educational level (P = 0.031; OR = 2.67; 95% CI = 
      1.186-6.045) and father's educational level (P = 0.004; OR = 3.56; 95% CI = 
      1.612-7.899). Similarly, among the supposed risk factors, rural residency (P = 
      0.032; OR = 1.76; 95% CI = 1.098- 2.851), absence of proper sewerage system (P = 
      0.000; OR = 6.60; 95% CI = 4.029-10.841) and unavailability of safe drinking water 
      (P = 0.000; OR = 4.08; 95% CI = 2.207-7.547) were the factors strongly connected 
      with giardiasis. Abdominal discomfort was a prominent clinical sign with 46% 
      frequency. CONCLUSION: Various risk factors were associated with occurrences of 
      Giardia, thus emphasizing the importance of parents' education, safe drinking water 
      and proper sewerage systems for Pakistani children's health.

TI  - Short Communication: Perception and attitude of pharmacy students towards learning 
      tools.
PG  - 2185-9
AB  - Use of technology in education has increased worldwide. Teaching methodologies are 
      shifting from traditional classroom lectures to e-learning and computer-based 
      learning. Pakistani students are also now fathoming necessity of acquiring tools for 
      strengthening their knowledge and skills. The objective of present study was to 
      analyze the shifting trends (perception and attitudes) of Pakistani Pharmacy 
      students towards learning tools. A survey based study conducted on 296 students from 
      various years of Pharmacy, studying in a state owned university, Karachi, Pakistan. 
      This study was initially piloted and Cronbach's-alpha was computed for evaluation of 
      internal consistency of questionnaire (for perception; 0.660, for attitude; 0.777 
      respectively). Data was computed by SPSS, version 16 (Crosstab) and Chisquare 
      (P=0.05). Most of the students strongly agreed (53%; χ² =495;P<0.05) that 
      introducing technology will improve learning; books are reliable reading source 
      (53%; χ² =437.23; P<0.05) or book-reading is essential (50%; χ² =360.36; P<0.05) 
      while others disagreed that they only study from class lectures (31%; χ² =17.22; 
      P<0.05); not take classes (41%; χ² =48.21; P<0.05); have used software (44%; χ² 
      =46.54; P<0.05). Majority of the students agreed on incorporating technology to 
      improve learning. Other factors such as unavailability and expenditure of books 
      influenced their ability to learn. This study might assist policy makers in 
      developing policies that could improve learning.

      exploratory study.
PG  - 332-6
LID - 10.1016/j.nedt.2011.10.011 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Caring is considered to be a highly abstract concept. Nurturing a 
      caring attitude in nursing education is important as this is the first place for 
      students to learn about the most significant values and essence of their profession. 
      AIM: The aim of the study was to describe the concept of caring from the perspective 
      of nursing students. METHODOLOGY: An exploratory research design was utilised for 
      this study. Eight senior nursing students from one government institute (College of 
      Nursing) in X country were recruited as study participants. Data was generated 
      through in-depth one-to-one interviews and analysed using Creswell's six-step guide 
      for qualitative data analysis. The interviews were tape recorded and a "member 
      check" technique was used. FINDINGS: The study results found the themes of caring as 
      a mothering relationship, helping attitude, limit setting, communication, and a 
      source of empowerment and development. CONCLUSION: The implications of the findings 
      for nursing education, faculty development, and research are described in the study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the appropriateness of WFME Basic Medical Education (BME) 
      standards to Pakistani context. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional survey of 
      faculty, graduates and students of five Masters' in Health Professions Education 
      programmes was carried out from Jul-Dec 2017. Participants were asked to rate the 
      appropriateness of WFME-BME basic standards to Pakistani context on a fourpoint 
      Likert scale (Strongly Disagree through to Strongly Agree). They were also asked for 
      additional comments, if any. Descriptive statistics were carried out for 
      quantitative data, while content analysis for qualitative data. RESULTS: A total of 
      127/200 participants responded (63.5%). For all major areas (106 standards), 97.7% 
      responses (n=13,149) were positive while only 2.3% (n=313) were negative. Ninety-six 
      standards got more than 95% positive response while only 10 standards in three major 
      areas got more than five percent negative response. These include five standards 
      from major area Mission and Outcomes, one from Educational Programme and four from 
      Students. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study exploring the appropriateness of 
      WFME-BME standards for accreditation in Pakistan. We found that all the areas, 
      sub-areas and standards are largely appropriate. We recommend further deliberation 
      on 10 standards with more than five percent negative responses, regarding their 
      contextualization to Pakistan and the development of guidelines and possible 
      reconsiderations in WFME future revisions.

OAB - The health status of the UK's Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi, and East African 
      minorities is significantly poorer than that of the white population. Improvements 
      in the health experiences of these minorities requires more than initiatives within 
      the traditional sphere of health services; needed is the political will to eradicate 
      inequalities in areas such as poverty, unemployment, and education that impact on 
      health status. To date, efforts to improve the health of Asians in the UK have 
      focused on health education, with an emphasis on culture and victim-blaming rather 
      than social circumstances. Racism within the National Health Service (NHS) affects 
      virtually all blacks, including Asians, and such prejudice and stereotyping has an 
      adverse effect on service delivery. This racism also affects minority employees of 
      the NHS and medical students. The health services need to drive out racial 
      discrimination from service delivery and employment. Health professionals need to 
      raise awareness of political, social, economic, and environmental determinants of 
      health. To dispel false notions of biological determinism, research on the health of 
      minorities needs to be conducted in the context of their disadvantaged status. 
      Finally, health professionals need to speak out against racial discrimination that 
      keeps Asians and other ethnic minorities in low standards of health and social 
      existence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalence of professionalism lapses related to academic 
      integrity by students Pakistani medical colleges. SUBJECTS: 520 students. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Cross sectional. DATA COLLECTION: A validated and customized version of 
      Dundee Polyprofessional Inventory-1 for use in Pakistani medical schools was used. 
      The students' perceptions on 47 behaviors were explored. RESULT: The response rate 
      of students was 92%. Ninety percent or more than 90% of student agreed that 30 of 
      the 47 listed behaviors were wrong. Different percentages of the students admitted 
      doing 44 (94%), out of 47 behaviors. Students thought that fellow students were 
      doing dishonest behaviors far more frequently than they themselves were. The 
      commonest dishonest behaviors admitted were proxy attendance (308, 64%), receiving 
      information about the paper from a student who has already sat in the exam, or 
      themselves providing information about a paper who have yet to sit in it (297, 62%), 
      completing work for another student 291 (61%). CONCLUSION: There are significant 
      issues related to academic integrity in Pakistani medical schools that require 
      remedy. The Dundee Polyprofessional Inventory-1 as customized for use in Pakistan is 
      a useful tool to measure professionalism lapses related to academic integrity.

TI  - Self-Reported Effectiveness of e-Learning Classes during COVID-19 Pandemic: A 
      Nation-Wide Survey of Pakistani Undergraduate Dentistry Students.
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1717000 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES:  The main aim of this study was to determine the undergraduate dental 
      students' self-reported effectiveness of online classes offered by various dental 
      institutes of Pakistan. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  A cross-sectional study was 
      conducted using an online survey. A pretested and validated questionnaire comprising 
      of 31 questions was circulated among dental students. The study participants were 
      inquired about the perceived level of accessibility of resources and the 
      effectiveness of online teaching. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 24. 
      Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for statistical analysis at p 
      ≤0.05. RESULTS:  A total of 1,207 students from all over Pakistan responded. The 
      majority of students was dissatisfied with the institutional learning management 
      system and quality of learning resources available. Students were also dissatisfied 
      with the level of training of teachers for online lectures. The worst rating was 
      reported for questions related to the effectiveness of online classes (average 
      rating: 3.83 and 3.781/5). First-year students reported poor interaction with 
      teachers (p < 0.001) and strongly disagreed with the effectiveness of online classes 
      (mean rating: 4.14 ± 0.935). CONCLUSIONS:  The results from the present survey 
      showed that dental students of Pakistan unanimously voiced dissatisfaction toward 
      various elements of online teaching sessions. Findings from this survey will aid the 
      academic institutes to establish proficient learning platforms focused on improving 
      students` learning experience.

AB  - PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to compare the knowledge and attitudes of 
      pharmacy and medical students regarding adverse drug reactions (ADRs), as well as 
      their perceptions of barriers to ADR reporting, in a Higher Education 
      Commission-recognised Pakistani university. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was 
      conducted among final-year pharmacy (n=91) and medical (n=108) students in Pakistan 
      from June 1 to July 31, 2014. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect 
      the data. The responses of pharmacy students were compared to those of medical 
      students. RESULTS: Pharmacy students had a significantly better knowledge of ADRs 
      than medical students (mean±SD, 5.61±1.78 vs. 3.23±1.60; P<0.001). Gender showed a 
      significant relationship to knowledge about ADRs, and male participants were 
      apparently more knowledgeable than their female counterparts (P<0.001). The 
      attitudes of pharmacy students regarding their capability to handle and report ADRs 
      were significantly more positive than those of medical students (P<0.05). In 
      comparison to pharmacy students, a lack of knowledge of where and how to report ADRs 
      was the main barrier that medical students perceived to ADR reporting (P=0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: Final-year pharmacy students exhibited more knowledge about ADRs and 
      showed more positive attitudes regarding their capacity to handle and report ADRs 
      than final-year medical students.

TI  - Sleep quality among medical students of Karachi, Pakistan.
PG  - 380-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterise sleep quality and assess degree of daytime sleepiness 
      among medical students of Karachi. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted 
      between August and December 2013 and subjects were recruited from five haphazardly 
      selected medical colleges in Karachi. A convenience sample of medical students 
      underwent two validated self-administered questionnaires i.e. Pittsburgh Sleep 
      Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. SPSS 17 was used for statistical 
      analysis. RESULTS: Of the 650 students approached, 504(77.5%) subjects completely 
      filled out the questionnaires. Of them, 300(59.5%) were females and 204(40.5%) were 
      males. Overall mean age was 20±1.4 years. Of them, 199(39.5%) were classified as 
      "Poor Sleepers". Poor sleep quality was associated with female gender (p <0.05), 
      excessive daytime sleepiness (p <0.05), total hours slept (p <0.001) and sleep 
      disturbances (p <0.001). Bed-timing analysis showed 365(72%) students went to bed 
      after midnight. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep quality among Pakistani medical students was 
      significantly poor. Efforts must be directed towards proper sleep hygiene education.

TI  - Knowledge and attitudes of Pakistani medical students towards HIV-positive and/or 
      AIDS patients.
PG  - 7-17
AB  - As the incidence of HIV increases, one of the major steps in preventing a widespread 
      epidemic is to make certain that medical students are prepared to recognize and 
      treat HIV infections and their related conditions, and to counsel patients about 
      avoiding risks that might lead to infections. This cross-sectional study assessed 
      the knowledge level of 357 medical students and their attitudes about AIDS and HIV 
      enrolled in a Medical College in Karachi, Pakistan. Only 6% of the students had 
      complete knowledge on symptoms of HIV/AIDS and 7% of the students had complete 
      knowledge on the modes of transmission of HIV. Statistical analysis of demographic 
      factors affecting knowledge was done. Linear regression and Maentel-Haenszel tests 
      showed that older and clinical students were more knowledgeable of symptoms and 
      modes of transmission of HIV/AIDS. Ten attitudes were correlated with knowledge and 
      none of these showed an association. These results on knowledge indicate that 
      education about HIV/AIDS should be incorporated in the curriculum and interventions 
      must be taken by public health professionals to avoid poor treatment outcomes.

TI  - Promoting motivation towards community health care: a qualitative study from nurses 
      in Pakistan.
PG  - 501-3
AB  - Based on the extensive health care needs of Pakistani population, the idea of 
      Community Health Nursing was introduced in 1985. The educational nursing institutes 
      adopted nursing curriculum in order to produce competent nurses to meet the rising 
      demands of society. However, very few numbers of nurses choose community health 
      nursing as their career pathway in Pakistan. Based on the current observation, 
      enhancing motivation among graduate nurses has always been viewed as a great 
      challenge for the academic nursing institutions. This study was intended to explore 
      motivating and de motivating factors in nurses towards community Health Nursing. By 
      utilizing self concept based model of motivation, semi structured interviews were 
      conducted with newly graduated nurses, nurse educators and nursing students. The 
      findings revealed that certain traits, values and competencies are required to 
      motivate nurses as well as to build their capacity towards working effectively in 
      the community setting. Moreover, through this study several realistic 
      recommendations by the participants are highlighted that could foster motivation 
      among future nurses towards this field.

TI  - Working toward decreasing infant mortality in developing countries through change in 
      the medical curriculum.
PG  - 11
LID - 10.1186/1447-056X-10-11 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High infant and maternal mortality rates are one of the biggest health 
      issues in Pakistan. Although these rates are given high priority at the national 
      level (Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5, respectively), there has been no 
      significant decrease in them so far. We hypothesize that this lack of success is 
      because the undergraduate curriculum in Pakistan does not match local needs. 
      Currently, the Pakistani medical curriculum deals with issues in maternal and child 
      morbidity and mortality according to Western textbooks. Moreover, these are taught 
      disjointedly through various departments. We undertook curriculum revision to 
      sensitize medical students to maternal and infant mortality issues important in the 
      Pakistani context and educate them about ways to reduce the same through an 
      integrated teaching approach. METHODS: The major determinants of infant mortality in 
      underdeveloped countries were identified through a literature review covering 
      international research produced over the last 10 years and the Pakistan Demographic 
      Health Survey 2006-07. An interdisciplinary maternal and child health module team 
      was created by the Medical Education Department at Shifa College of Medicine. The 
      curriculum was developed based on the role of identified determinants in infant and 
      maternal mortality. It was delivered by an integrated team without any subject 
      boundaries. Students' knowledge, skills, and attitudes were assessed by multiple 
      modalities and the module itself by student feedback using questionnaires and focus 
      group discussions. RESULTS: Assessment and feedback demonstrated that the students 
      had developed a thorough understanding of the complexity of factors that contribute 
      to infant mortality. Students also demonstrated knowledge and skill in counseling, 
      antenatal care, and care of newborns and infants. CONCLUSIONS: A carefully designed 
      integrated curriculum can help sensitize undergraduate medical students and equip 
      them to identify and address complex issues related to maternal and infant mortality 
      in underdeveloped countries.

AB  - Depression, anxiety, and stress are among major psychological disorders being 
      predominant in present day. This study proposed to analyze the role of Muslim 
      religiosity in male students showing these mental indications. A sample including 
      723 Pakistani young adults enrolled at college level was randomly chosen. Muslim 
      Religiosity Measurement Scale and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale were utilized 
      to gather information. Discoveries uncover an inverse relationship between conduct 
      and affiliation with the symptoms of mental disorders, anxiety and stress among the 
      respondents. Results bolster the incorporation of religious dimensions in 
      psychological wellness and mental well-being thought of young adults in Pakistan.

TI  - Capacity development for health research in Pakistan: the effects of doctoral 
      training.
PG  - 338-43
AB  - Capacity development for health research has been promoted in developing countries 
      for many years, especially by international aid agencies. In Pakistan the government 
      has been investing substantial funds in the development of a critical mass of 
      scientists in the country. This paper represents the first attempt in Pakistan to 
      assess the impact of capacity development efforts in health research. The study 
      surveyed 54 Pakistani researchers who were sent for doctoral training to 
      institutions out of the country on funded programmes in the past three decades. The 
      50 male and four female respondents had an average of 5.7 years of job experience 
      prior to being sent for training and the average duration of training per person was 
      4 years. The average reported expenditure directly given to the trainees was US 
      dollars 35300 (1995 US dollars) per person. These researchers had an average of 15 
      publications per person, while they have trained an average of nine students per 
      researcher since return to Pakistan. The respondents indicated a lack of academic 
      liberty and incentives to sustain their research efforts, and recommended autonomy 
      in work and provision of facilities to stimulate their contributions. This study 
      reflects the complex issues facing highly trained researchers who have returned to 
      Pakistan and are attempting to pursue their careers. Their contributions in terms of 
      writing papers, teaching students and policy involvement are important for assessing 
      capacity development efforts. Comparative data from other developing nations is 
      severely lacking for cross-country analysis. Such evaluations are critical to 
      develop plans for the reduction of the 10/90 gap in health research investments.

TI  - Family-centered rounds in Pakistani pediatric intensive care settings: 
      non-randomized pre- and post-study design.

LID - 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2012.05.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Involvement of family in bedside rounds is one strategy to implement 
      family-centered care to help families get clear information about their child, and 
      be actively involved in decision-making about care. However in developing countries 
      such as Pakistan, daily bedside rounds include the physician, residents, medical 
      students and a nurse/technician. Parents are not currently a part of these rounds. 
      OBJECTIVE: To assess whether family-centered rounds improve parents' and health care 
      professionals' satisfaction, decrease patient length of stay, and improve time 
      utilization when compared to traditional practice rounds in a population with a low 
      literacy rate, socioeconomic status, and different cultural values and beliefs. 
      DESIGN: A non-randomized before-after study design. SETTING: A private hospital in 
      Karachi, Pakistan. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 82 parents, whose children 
      were hospitalized for a minimum of 48h, and 25 health care professionals able to 
      attend two consecutive rounds. METHODS: During the before phase, traditional bedside 
      rounds were practiced; and during after phase, family-centered rounds were 
      practiced. Parents and health care professionals completed a questionnaire on the 
      second day of rounds. An observational form facilitated data collection on length of 
      stay and time utilization during. RESULTS: Parents' ratings during the 
      family-centered rounds were significantly higher for some parental satisfaction 
      items: evidence of team work (p=0.007), use of simple language during the rounds 
      (p=0.002), feeling of inclusion in discussion at rounds (p=0.03), decision making 
      (p=0.01), and preference for family-centered rounds (p=<0.001). No significant 
      differences were found in health care professionals' satisfaction between rounds. 
      Patient length of stay was significantly reduced in the family-centered rounds 
      group, while no significant difference was found in the duration of rounds. 
      Family-centered rounds served as an opportunity for parents to correct/add to 
      patient history or documentation. CONCLUSION: Parents were satisfied with both forms 
      of rounds; however, they appeared to have a greater preference for family-centered 
      rounds than health care professionals. Family-centered rounds were a resource for 
      Pakistani parents, enabling direct communication with the medical team without 
      impacting on the time required to complete rounds. Family-centered rounds may 
      improve quality of care such as decreasing length of stay or preventing critical 
      incidents.

TI  - Cephalometric measurments of a Pakistani adult sample according to Jarabak's 
      analysis.
PG  - 1345-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish cephalometric norms of Pakistani adults according to 
      Jarabak's analysis and to evaluate whether a significant difference exists between 
      Pakistani measurements and Jarabak's norms. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional 
      study, was carried out at the Department of Orthodontics Dr. Ishratul Ebad Institute 
      Of Oral Heath Sciences/Sindh Dental Hospital, Karachi from July to September 2012. 
      Standardized lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken of 50 selected Pakistanis 
      within age range 18-23 years having normal occlusion. The database was developed in 
      SPSS 12.0 for Windows. RESULT: A descriptive analysis and independent Student's test 
      was used. A comparison of the angular and linear measurements according to the 
      Jarabak's analysis in the Pakistani and Caucasian population describe that the 
      Pakistani males had all of their angular as well as linear measurements 
      significantly different then the Caucasian namely the saddle angle, gonial angle, 
      articular angle, upper gonial angle and lower gonial angle (p < 0.0001) and the 
      anterior cranial base, posterior cranial base, ramus height, anterior facial height, 
      posterior facial height and mandibular corpus (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Pakistani 
      males and females demonstrated a significant difference in saddle angle, gonial 
      angle, articular angle, upper gonial angle and lower gonial angle (p < 0.0001) as 
      compared to the Caucasian norms. Pakistani females also had a difference in the 
      upper gonial angle and lower gonial angle (p < 0.0001) and the anterior cranial 
      base, posterior cranial base, ramus height, anterior facial height, posterior facial 
      height and mandibular corpus measurements.

TI  - Smoking habits and beliefs of future physicians of Pakistan.
PG  - 915-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the habits, knowledge and attitudes towards smoking among 
      Pakistani medical students. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from 
      March 2004 to July 2005 at three medical colleges using a World Health Organization 
      (WHO) questionnaire. A total of 1,029 medical students participated in the study. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of smoking was found to be 11.2%. Smoking was more prevalent 
      among males, hostel residents and first year medical students. Almost half of the 
      smokers had tried to quit smoking. A family member or a friend was considered to be 
      the most likely person to help quit smoking. The majority believed that passive 
      smoking was harmful to health and were generally supportive of legislative measures 
      to reduce tobacco use, such as the restriction of smoking in public places and the 
      prohibition of sale of tobacco to children. Lesser but significant numbers thought 
      that there should be a complete ban on smoking advertisements and that the price of 
      tobacco products should be increased. CONCLUSION: The study shows a high prevalence 
      of tobacco use in future physicians in spite of adequate knowledge about and a 
      satisfactory attitude towards smoking.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading 
      cause of cancer death in females' worldwide. Pakistan has higher incidence of the 
      disease than the neighboring countries and one in every nine Pakistani women suffers 
      from breast cancer which is one of the highest incidence rate in Asia. Numerous risk 
      factors such as nulliparity, family history, genetic mutations, increasing age, 
      early menarche, and late menopause are associated with the development of breast 
      cancer. Lack of awareness and the preexisting myths regarding this disease have led 
      to the detection of breast cancer at a later stage. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of 
      this study is to determine the frequency of adequate breast cancer knowledge and its 
      level among nonmedical women of Karachi coming to attend general surgery outpatient 
      clinics. METHODS: A cross-sectional Study was conducted in Outpatient Clinics, 
      Department of General Surgery, Civil Hospital, Karachi. The sample of 250 females 
      with nonmedical background was gathered from December 27, 2016 to June 26, 2017. 
      Adequate breast cancer knowledge was divided into three criteria such as poor, fair, 
      and good knowledge. Chi-square test was applied. P ≤ 0.05 was considered as 
      statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean age was 35.63 ± 9.56 years. Mean 
      knowledge score was 5.24 ± 2.92. Overall, 42% of participants were found with 
      adequate breast cancer knowledge whereas 58% of the participants had inadequate 
      knowledge. Based on the study questionnaire, 38% had poor knowledge, 40.4% had fair 
      knowledge, and 21.6% had good knowledge. Significant association was observed with 
      age, monthly family income, education status, and occupation. CONCLUSION: The 
      results showed lack of adequate knowledge. A high proportion (58%) of nonmedical 
      females had inadequate knowledge about breast cancer.

TI  - Factors contributing to early menarche in school girls.
PG  - 629-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the average age of menarche in Pakistani girls from different 
      socioeconomic backgrounds. METHODOLOGY: This was a cross sectional study design 
      carried out on female students studying in different schools of Karachi in 2014. 
      Girls aged 10-14 years age were included. Schools from all three socio economic 
      strata were selected through random sampling technique from a list of schools having 
      health care services. Data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire 
      translated in Urdu where required. Height and Weight was measured through calibrated 
      instruments. Sample size was n=385 based on maximum proportion of 50%. Analysis was 
      done on SPSS version 20. Chi-square and ANOVA was applied after checking data for 
      normality. RESULTS: The total sample size was 275 after excluding poorly filled 
      questionnaires. The mean age of menarche in our sample population was 11.73±1.2 
      years. Out of the total participants 127 (46%) students had reached the age of 
      menarche. It was found that mean age of menarche was highest in participants of 
      Kashmiri origin 14.5±0.1 years and lowest mean age was observed in those of Gujrati 
      origin at 11.0±0.1 years (p 0.036). When mean age of menarche was compared with 
      socioeconomic class highest mean age was observed in lower class 12.13 ±0.1 (p 
      0.268). CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a decline in the mean age of menarche of at 
      least 2 years in girls aged 10-14 years.

AB  - This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the knowledge of a Pakistani university 
      population (students and employees) regarding Ebola virus disease. A total of 2,200 
      individuals were approached and 1,647 were enrolled in the study. We observed that 
      the vast majority of study participants (91.8%) had inadequate knowledge of Ebola 
      virus disease (knowledge score ≤ 12). Our findings highlight the need to increase 
      the knowledge of Ebola virus disease by using multidimensional approach involving 
      awareness campaigns, print, electronic, and social media.

AB  - Cross-culturally measurement invariant instruments are useful for the assessment of 
      mental symptoms across cultures. The current study aimed to investigate the 
      psychometric properties and measurement invariance of the Depression, Anxiety and 
      Stress Scales (DASS-21) (DASS) across Pakistan and Germany. German participants were 
      recruited through an online survey (N = 1323), while Pakistani participants were 
      recruited through online survey or paper-and-pencil survey (N = 1841). The DASS-21 
      showed good reliability, construct and structure validity in both countries. The 
      DASS-21 indicated partial weak (stress subscale) and partial strong measurement 
      invariance (depression and anxiety subscales) between both countries. Latent mean 
      comparison of depression and anxiety symptoms between Pakistani and German students 
      indicated that Pakistani university students experience more symptoms of depression 
      and anxiety. Results suggest that the DASS-21 could be used in Pakistan and Germany, 
      but caution should be taken when making direct comparisons between the two 
      countries.

AB  - OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death worldwide, with 
      new threats of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. 
      Pakistan is the fifth highest among high-burden TB countries and the fourth highest 
      among high-burden drug-resistant-TB countries. Pakistan is the sixth most populous 
      country in the world, and Pakistani youth is the highest population group in 
      Pakistan and second in the world. This study was aimed at assessing the 
      understanding, awareness, and mindset of university students toward TB, MDR TB, and 
      XDR TB in Lahore. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was performed 
      on 1137 individuals from three major public-sector universities in Lahore, Pakistan. 
      Information regarding their knowledge and attitude toward MDR and XDR TB was 
      gathered using a structured questionnaire. Data collected was analyzed using SPSS 
      version 20. RESULTS: Male (531) and female (606) students were asked about different 
      aspects of MDR and XDR TB. Although 80.47% students had good knowledge about simple 
      TB, a very small fraction had awareness and appropriate knowledge about MDR/XDR-TB. 
      Considering TB as a stigma, only 9.3% students disclosed that they had household TB 
      contact. Only 25% students knew about XDR TB. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that 
      a small fraction of people knew the exact definition and treatment duration of MDR 
      TB and XDR TB in our society. There is a need to increase the awareness and 
      knowledge status of university students about MDR and XDR TB.

TI  - Developing counseling skills through pre-recorded videos and role play: a pre- and 
      post-intervention study in a Pakistani medical school.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interactive methods like role play, recorded video scenarios and 
      objective structured clinical exam (OSCE) are being regularly used to teach and 
      assess communication skills of medical students in the western world. In developing 
      countries however, they are still in the preliminary phases of execution in most 
      institutes. Our study was conducted in a naïve under resourced setup to assess the 
      impact of such teaching methodologies on the counseling skills of medical students. 
      METHODS: Fifty four 4th year MBBS students were identified to be evaluated for 
      communication skills by trained facilitators in a pre-intervention OSCE. The same 
      group of students was given a demonstration of ideal skill level by means of videos 
      and role playing sessions in addition to real life interaction with patients during 
      hospital and community rotations. A post-intervention evaluation was carried out six 
      months later through OSCE and direct observation through structured checklist (DOS) 
      in hospital and community settings. The combined and individual performance levels 
      of these students were analyzed. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant 
      difference in the communication skills of students when assessed in the 
      post-intervention OSCE (p = 0.000). Individual post-intervention percentages of 
      study participants displayed improvement as well (n = 45, p = 0.02). No difference 
      was observed between the scores of male and female students when assessed for two 
      specific competencies of antenatal care and breast feeding counseling (p = 0.11). 
      The mean DOS (%) score of 12 randomly selected students was much lower as compared 
      to the post-intervention (%) score but the difference between them was statistically 
      non significant, a result that may have been affected by the small sample size as 
      well as other factors that may come into play in real clinical settings and were not 
      explored in this study (59.41 +/- 7.8 against 82.43 +/- 22.08, p = 0.88). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Videos and role play in combination with community and clinical 
      exposure are effective modes of teaching counseling skills to medical students. They 
      can be successfully utilized even in a limited resource setup, as demonstrated by 
      our trial.

TI  - Phenotypic spectrum and responses to recombinant human IGF1 (rhIGF1) therapy in 
      patients with homozygous intronic pseudoexon growth hormone receptor mutation.
PG  - 481-489
LID - 10.1530/EJE-18-0042 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with homozygous intronic pseudoexon GH receptor (GHR) mutations 
      (6Ψ) have growth hormone insensitivity (GHI) (growth failure, IGF1 deficiency and 
      normal/elevated serum GH). We report 9 patients in addition to previously described 
      11 GHR 6Ψ patients and their responses to rhIGF1 therapy. METHODS: 20 patients (12 
      males, 11 families, mean age 4.0 ± 2.2 years) were diagnosed genetically in our 
      centre. Phenotypic data and responses to rhIGF1 treatment were provided by referring 
      clinicians. Continuous parametric variables were compared using Student t-test or 
      ANOVA. RESULTS: 10/20 (50%) had typical facial features of GHI, 19/20 (95%) from 
      consanguineous families and 18/20 (90%) of Pakistani origin. At diagnosis, mean 
      height SDS: -4.1 ± 0.95, IGF1 SDS: -2.8 ± 1.4; IGFBP3 SDS: -3.0 ± 2.1 and mean basal 
      and peak GH levels: 11.9 µg/L and 32.9 µg/L, respectively. 1/12 who had IGF1 
      generation test, responded (IGF1: 132-255 ng/mL). 15/20 (75%; 11M) received rhIGF1 
      (mean dose: 114 µg/kg twice daily, mean duration: 5.3 ± 2.5 years). Mean baseline 
      height velocity of 4.7 ± 1.1 cm/year increased to 7.4 ± 1.8 cm/year (P = 0.001) 
      during year 1 of therapy. Year 3 mean height SDS (-3.2 ± 1.0) was higher than 
      pre-treatment height SDS (-4.3 ± 0.8) (P = 0.03). Mean cumulative increase in height 
      SDS after year 5 was 1.4 ± 0.9. Difference between target height (TH) SDS and adult 
      or latest height SDS was less than that of TH SDS and pre-treatment height SDS 
      (2.1 ± 1.2 vs 3.0 ± 0.8; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: In addition to phenotypic 
      heterogeneity in the cohort, there was mismatch between clinical and biochemical 
      features in individual patients with 6Ψ GHR mutations. rhIGF1 treatment improved 
      height outcomes.

TI  - Development of Evidence-Based Disease Education Literature for Pakistani Rheumatoid 
      Arthritis Patients.
LID - 10.3390/diseases5040027 [doi]
LID - 27
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis affects 0.5% to 1% of the population globally and is one of the 
      most common causes of disability. Patient education plays a key role in improving 
      treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to discuss the process involved in 
      designing an evidence-based disease education literature for rheumatoid arthritis 
      patients of Pakistan in Urdu language with culturally relevant illustrations. A 
      study was conducted to develop disease education literature using Delphi consensus, 
      content validity, and patient feedback. A panel of experts comprised of university 
      professors and health care experts, including health practitioners and pharmacists 
      as well as a social scientist, was set up to assess the need. Eight patients were 
      randomly selected and were asked to give their feedback. Their feedback was 
      incorporated in the development process. The entire process was carried out in eight 
      steps. A disease education literature for patients of rheumatoid arthritis was 
      developed and edited in the form of a booklet. The booklet contained evidence-based 
      information that must be provided to patients in both Urdu and English languages 
      with culturally relevant illustrations. The availability of such literature is 
      significant, as it enables the patients to seek knowledge at home at their 
      convenience. This home-based knowledge support is as helpful as any other means of 
      medical care. The developed literature is planned to be used in further studies 
      which will evaluate its impact in improving knowledge of RA patients.

TI  - The Pressing Need to Raise Awareness about Osteoarthritis Care among Elderly Females 
      in Pakistan: A Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - e5302
LID - 10.7759/cureus.5302 [doi]
LID - e5302
AB  - Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is the single-most common cause of physical 
      disability among adults. In view of its promising management modalities, an analysis 
      of the level of awareness among the suspected individuals and their attitudes is 
      crucial to assess the level of their implementation. This study aimed to do that 
      among the female population in Karachi, Pakistan. Methods This cross-sectional study 
      was conducted among 316 elderly females (≥60 years) in Karachi in 2018. Data were 
      collected via a structured questionnaire, which included sections titled: 
      demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Data were analyzed using the 
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences (version 20.20, IBM, Armonk, New York, US), 
      and chi-square tests were used to assess the connection between OA care and 
      socioeconomic statuses. Mean and standard deviation were calculated for quantitative 
      variables. Results A considerable portion (48%, n = 152) of the participants were 
      from a lower socioeconomic background, and 51% of them had a history of joint pain. 
      Significantly, 63% of the participants (n = 199) attributed their joint pain to age, 
      while nearly half attributed it to their diet and exercise habits. A major segment 
      (73%, n = 230) of the participants, irrespective of their socioeconomic backgrounds, 
      had visited a doctor for their joint complaints. Around 65% of the participants said 
      they would never undergo a knee-joint replacement, regardless of how worse their 
      symptoms might get. Additionally, 36% of the participants were unsatisfied with 
      their current treatment, while more than half of the participants said that 
      medication would improve their condition. Conclusions Our results demonstrate a 
      connection between the lack of awareness about OA and the factors negatively 
      affecting its management. They also point towards areas that require focused efforts 
      for better awareness.

TI  - Knowledge, attitudes and practice of university students regarding waterpipe smoking 
      in Pakistan.
PG  - 1077-84
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the awareness, perceptions and practice of university students 
      in Karachi, Pakistan, with regard to shisha (waterpipe) smoking. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional survey conducted among students at four different universities of 
      Karachi, selected through random cluster sampling. RESULTS: A total of 450 
      participants, 59.6% males (n=268) and 40.4% females (n=182), were included in the 
      study. About half of the participants reported having ever smoked shisha (n=241, 
      53.6%). On examining factors associated with starting shisha smoking, curiosity was 
      found to be the most common reason (n=148, 61.4%), followed by pleasure-seeking 
      (n=113, 46.9%), peer pressure (n=55, 22.8%), boredom (n=43, 17.8%) and stress (n=26, 
      10.8%). Of 241 participants who had ever smoked waterpipes, the majority (n=149, 
      61.8%) were current smokers. A vast majority of participants (n=269, 60%) considered 
      waterpipe smoking to be less unhealthy than cigarette smoking. Boredom in youth, use 
      of waterpipe in leisure activities and peer pressure were identified as the most 
      common reasons for the escalating popularity of waterpipe smoking in Pakistan. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Waterpipe smoking is very popular among Pakistani university students, 
      and knowledge among university students about the dangers of waterpipe smoking is 
      alarmingly low.

      ages 18 and 40, had body mass index between 18 and 25 Kg/m(2), and were students or 
      early-career professionals. These individuals donated a total of 61 samples (32 gut 
      and 29 oral) that were subjected to 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. 
      Microbiome composition of Pakistani individuals was compared against the uBiome 
      database of selected individuals who self-reported to be in excellent health. We 
      observed strong gender-based differences in the gut microbiome of Pakistani 
      individuals, a skewness toward Firmicutes, and unusually high levels of 
      Proteobacteria in the Pakistani men. These observations may indicate microbiota 
      dysbiosis, though 16S data alone can neither establish cause nor effect to human 
      health. Albeit conducted on a smaller scale, our report provides a first snapshot 
      about the composition and diversity of gut and oral microbiota communities in 
      Pakistani individuals.

TI  - Ethnicity and waterpipe smoking among US students.
PG  - 1551-7
LID - 10.5588/ijtld.12.0152 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of ethnicity on waterpipe smoking among college 
      students. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study utilized data from University of Houston 
      students through an online survey (n = 2334) from March to April 2011. The survey 
      included questions on demographic characteristics (sex, age, race/ethnicity), 
      tobacco use experience, risk perception, social acceptability and popularity. 
      Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of waterpipe use 
      with three outcomes: ever-use vs. no use, past-year use vs. no use and past-month 
      use vs. no use. RESULTS: Half of the sample had previously smoked tobacco using a 
      waterpipe, approximately a third in the past year and 12.5% in the past month. 
      Significant predictors included Middle Eastern ethnicity, Middle Eastern friend, 
      past cigarette or cigar use. Perception of harm was associated with less use in the 
      ever-use model, while perceived addictiveness, social acceptability and popularity 
      of waterpipes were predictors in all models. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the 
      importance of developing culturally appropriate interventions to control waterpipe 
      smoking among Middle Eastern Americans and those of Indian/Pakistani descent to curb 
      further spread in US society, and highlight the importance of developing 
      interventions that target the perceived addictiveness, social acceptability and 
      popularity of waterpipe smoking.

AB  - This study was designed to find out normative acoustic measures of adults in 
      Pakistan. Age and gender differences in these parameters were also studied. The 
      study variables include fundamental frequency, absolute jitter, relative jitter, 
      relative average perturbation, 5-point period perturbation quotient perturbation 
      quotient, jitter average absolute difference between consecutive periods, divided by 
      the average period, shimmer local, shimmer decibel, three-point amplitude 
      perturbation quotient, five-point amplitude perturbation quotient, average absolute 
      difference of consecutive differences between the consecutive periods' amplitudes, 
      and harmonics-to-noise ratio. Participants (N = 71; men = 34; women = 37) were 
      recruited through two-stage sampling; convenience and purposive sampling. 
      Participants were selected from students, staff, and faculty of the University of 
      the Punjab, caretakers of the clients coming for clinical services, and researchers' 
      friends, family, and acquaintances. Gender groups were further divided into three 
      subgroups based on the age bands of 21-30, 31-40, and 41-50 years. After screening 
      for health issues, the voice samples were recorded in a sound-proof acoustic 
      laboratory by using a stand-held microphone and Praat software. Praat was also used 
      for voice analyses. Means and standard deviations were conducted for the 
      participants. Age and gender differences were investigated by using the two-way 
      analysis of variance. Normative values were also measured for men and women between 
      the age bracket of 21 and 50 years. Age differences were not significant for any 
      variable. Gender differences were significant in fundamental frequency, absolute 
      jitter, relative jitter, jitter period perturbation quotient, shimmer five-point 
      amplitude perturbation quotient, and harmonics-to-noise ratio. The interaction 
      between age and gender was significant in all the jitter measures. The interaction 
      showed an increase in all these measures between the ages of 31 and 40 years and a 
      decrease between the ages of 41 and 50 years in women, whereas men showed a reverse 
      effect both in the age ranges of 31-40 and 41-50 years.

TI  - Differences between 9-11 year old British Pakistani and White British girls in 
      physical activity and behavior during school recess.
PG  - 1087
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-12-1087 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: School recess provides an important opportunity for children to engage 
      in physical activity. Previous studies indicate that children and adults of South 
      Asian origin are less active than other ethnic groups in the United Kingdom, but 
      have not investigated whether activity differs within the shared school environment. 
      The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that British Pakistani girls aged 
      9-11 years are less active during recess than White British girls. METHODS: In Study 
      One, the proportion of recess spent by 137 White British (N = 70) and British 
      Pakistani (N = 67) girls in sedentary behavior, moderate-to-vigorous activity (MVPA) 
      and vigorous activity (VPA) was determined using accelerometry. In Study Two, 86 
      White British (N = 48) and British Pakistani (N = 38) girls were observed on the 
      playground using the System for Observing Children's Activity and Relationships 
      during Play (SOCARP). Accelerometry data were collected during observations to allow 
      identification of activities contributing to objectively measured physical activity. 
      RESULTS: Accelerometry data indicated that British Pakistani girls spent 2.2% (95% 
      CI: 0.2, 4.3) less of their total recess time in MVPA and 1.3% (95% CI: 0.2, 2.4) 
      less in VPA than White British girls. Direct observation showed that British 
      Pakistani girls spent 12.0% (95% CI: 2.9, 21.1) less playground time being very 
      active, and 12.3% (95% CI: 1.7, 23.0) less time playing games. Time spent being very 
      active according to direct observation data correlated significantly with 
      accelerometer-assessed time spent in MVPA and VPA, and time spent playing games 
      correlated significantly with accelerometer-assessed time spent in VPA, suggesting 
      that differences in behavior observed in Study Two may have contributed to the 
      differences in time spent in MVPA and VPA in Study One. CONCLUSIONS: British 
      Pakistani girls were less active than White British girls during school recess. 
      Recess has been identified as a potentially important target for the delivery of 
      physical activity interventions; such interventions should consider ways in which 
      the activity levels of British Pakistani girls could be increased.

AB  - Although migration itself may not compromise the mental health of immigrants, the 
      acculturative process can involve highly stressful factors that are specific to 
      immigrant and minority status. Using structural equation modeling, this study 
      examined the relations between acculturation orientations, perceived discrimination, 
      acculturative stress, and psychological distress among 229 Pakistani and 218 
      Nepalese migrants living in Hong Kong. Although the initial hypothesized model was 
      not confirmed, a modified model with good fit indices showed that acculturation 
      orientation mediated the relationships of perceived discrimination and acculturative 
      stress with psychological distress. Of all the factors in the model, acculturative 
      stress had the strongest association with psychological distress.

TI  - Prevalence and determinants of susceptibility to cigarette smoking among school 
      students in Pakistan: secondary analysis of Global Youth Tobacco Survey.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/1747-597X-9-10 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to smoke has been recognized as a strong predictor of 
      smoking experimentation and taking up regular smoking habit. The identification of 
      smoking susceptible individuals and its determinants is important in the efforts to 
      reduce future smoking prevalence. The aims of this study are to estimate prevalence 
      of susceptibility to smoke among adolescents, and identify factors associated with 
      it. METHODS: Cross sectional data was obtained from Global Youth Tobacco Survey 
      conducted in three cities of Pakistan in year 2004. Study population consisted of 
      students in grades, 8th, 9th, and 10th; aged 13 to 15 years. Secondary analysis 
      using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to 
      estimate the associations between smoking susceptibility and co-variates. 
      Descriptive statistics were reported in proportions, and adjusted odds ratios with 
      95% confidence interval were used to report logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: 
      Approximately 12% of nonsmoking students were found susceptible to smoking. 
      Students, who were females (OR = 1.53, 95% CI [1.24-1.89]); whose parents 
      (OR = 1.64, 95% CI [1.35-1.99]); or close friend smoked (OR = 2.77, 95% CI [2.27- 
      3.40]) were more susceptible to cigarette smoking. Students who had good knowledge 
      about harmful effects of smoking (OR = 0.54, 95% CI [0.43-0.69]); and had access to 
      anti-smoking media (OR = 0.73, 95% CI [0.59-0.89]) were less likely to be 
      susceptible to smoking. CONCLUSION: Students who were females, had smoking parents, 
      friends or exposure to newspaper/magazines cigarette marketing, were more 
      susceptible to cigarette smoking among Pakistani adolescents. While knowledge of 
      harmful effects of smoking and access to anti-smoking media served as protective 
      factors against susceptibility to smoking.

      deadly disease. A detailed questionnaire regarding demographic data and information 
      about cervical cancer was distributed in different cities of Punjab. A total of 873 
      women took part in this survey and 70.1 percent were totally unaware of this cancer. 
      Only 8.5% of the whole surveyed population knew accurately about cancer of cervix, 
      7% of the surveyed respondents correctly specified the human papilloma virus as the 
      causative agent. Only 5.2% respondents were able to identify the Pap smear test as a 
      diagnostic measure. Out of all the surveyed population only 4.3% of individuals were 
      found to be vaccinated against this disease and the majority was found from the 
      medical profession. Medical professionals, students, working women, housewives and 
      uneducated individuals took active part in this survey. This study demonstrates a 
      low level of awareness among Pakistani women and a need for an active campaign by 
      media and government to increase understanding as well as introducing measures for 
      improved prevention and treatment of cervical cancer.

TI  - Predictability of medical students' performance at the Aga Khan University from 
      admission test scores, interview ratings and systems of education.
PG  - 374-80
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Performance in an admission test and carefully conducted, structured 
      interview provides a uniform basis for the assessment of applicants prepared in 
      different systems of education for admission to an institute of higher professional 
      learning. We studied the predictability of the system of education followed by the 
      students prior to entrance into the Medical College, the admission test scores, and 
      interview ratings on performance after five trimesters at the Aga Khan University 
      Medical College. METHOD: A cohort of 374 medical students who were admitted during 
      1989--1994, were considered. The associations between the admission test score, 
      interview ratings, system of education, and the scores obtained for anatomy, 
      physiology, biochemistry and community health sciences examinations held after five 
      trimesters were analysed using appropriate statistical procedures. RESULTS: 
      Interview ratings were associated with the scores in Physiology but not other 
      subjects. The chief finding of this study was the association between the system of 
      education and performance in both the admission test and the examination after five 
      trimesters. Students who followed the British school curricula for 13 years scored 
      significantly higher than those who followed the 12 years of the Pakistani system. 
      When controlled for the admission test score, the difference in mean scores of the 
      two groups was still evident for two subjects; community health sciences and 
      physiology. CONCLUSION: We believe that the evidence indicates differences in 
      learning methods inculcated by the system of education prior to entry into the 
      Medical College, notwithstanding the 1-year difference in duration of education.

TI  - Current Status and Future Suggestions for Improving the Pharm. D Curriculum towards 
      Clinical Pharmacy Practice in Pakistan.
LID - 10.3390/pharmacy5030046 [doi]
LID - 46
AB  - Objectives &amp; Background: Good curriculum is reflected as the backbone for 
      standard universities to develop competitive professionals having great potential. 
      Pharmacy education in Pakistan has gone through the same developmental stages as in 
      other countries, but is still striving for improvement. In the present study, we 
      want (i) to know the opinion on whether the current pharmacy curriculum requires any 
      improvement in order to meet the training needs of pharmacy professionals regarding 
      clinical knowledge and pharmacy practice; and (ii) to present some humble 
      suggestions to decision-making authorities in order to improve it with respect to 
      patient-focused programs (PFP). Methods: The study was conducted in two sessions. In 
      first session, a questionnaire was distributed to pharmacy students of eight 
      public/private sector universities of Karachi (N = 354) offering Pharm. D degrees. 
      The second session dealt with the pharmacy teachers, deans, and practicing 
      pharmacists in health care facilities (who are in any ways also related to 
      academia), in order to take their opinions on and suggestions for the development of 
      a better Pharm. D curriculum (N = 135). Results: Our results showed that 75.2% of 
      respondents agree that the Pharm. D curriculum does not meet the international 
      standards of practice, and 88.4% of respondents support the addition of more 
      clinical aspects than industrial ones, as Pharm. D could be both clinically and 
      industrially oriented, according to the needs of the Pakistani people. Furthermore, 
      80.2% of respondents are of the view that an apprenticeship should be included in 
      last two years, while 88.4% demand a 'paid residency program' to facilitate the 
      hospital, clinical and compounding areas of pharmacy. In addition, we also received 
      a number of verbal suggestions for improving the Pharm. D curriculum being followed 
      in Pakistan. Discussion &amp; Conclusions: We conclude that our Pharm. D curriculum 
      needs additions in terms of clinical practice by providing residencies and electives 
      in health care settings. Accordingly, the need for a clinically oriented curriculum 
      is highlighted in Pakistan, keeping in mind the continuing importance of the 
      industrial viewpoint. Various studies have criticized the pharmacy curriculum in 
      Pakistan in the past. Conversely, we suggest some changes in the curriculum, as 
      change is always needed for a better tomorrow.

TI  - Technology-Assisted Teachers' Training to Promote Socioemotional Well-Being of 
      Children in Public Schools in Rural Pakistan.
PG  - appips202000005

AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization's (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Regional 
      Office (EMRO) developed a school mental health program (SMHP) to help reduce the 
      burden of youth mental health problems. Designed in collaboration with international 
      consultants, the SMHP draws on evidence-based interventions to train personnel to 
      identify students in need, respond therapeutically, and engage families in seeking 
      care. METHODS: Teams from Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, and Jordan collaborated with the 
      WHO EMRO and British and U.S. universities to form the School Health Implementation 
      Network: Eastern Mediterranean Region (SHINE), a National Institute of Mental 
      Health-funded global mental health hub. SHINE partners used a "theory of change" 
      process to adapt the SMHP to be more readily adopted by school personnel and 
      replicated with fidelity. The adapted SMHP more directly addresses teachers' 
      priorities and uses technology to facilitate training. RESULTS: A cluster-randomized 
      implementation effectiveness trial enrolling 960 children ages 8-13 in 80 Pakistani 
      schools will test the adapted SMHP against the original. Children who screen 
      positive on first the teacher and subsequently the parent Strengths and Difficulties 
      Questionnaires (SDQs) will be enrolled and tracked for 9 months. The primary trial 
      outcome is reduction in parent-rated SDQ total difficulties scores. Secondary 
      outcomes include children's well-being, academic performance, absenteeism, and 
      perceived stigma; parent-teacher interaction; teachers' self-efficacy and subjective 
      well-being; and school environment. Implementation outcomes include change in 
      teachers' behavior and sense of program acceptability, cultural appropriateness, 
      feasibility, penetration, and sustainability. NEXT STEPS: The trial began in October 
      2019, and the expected completion date is March 2021. Outcomes will inform 
      dissemination of the SMHP in Pakistan and elsewhere.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently there is a growing concern about stress during undergraduate 
      medical training. However, studies about the same are lacking from Pakistani medical 
      schools. The objectives of our study were to assess perceived stress, sources of 
      stress and their severity and to assess the determinants of stressed cases. METHODS: 
      A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey was carried out among undergraduate 
      medical students of CMH Lahore Medical College, Pakistan during January to March 
      2009. Perceived stress was assessed using the perceived stress scale. A 33-item 
      questionnaire was used to assess sources of stress and their severity. RESULTS: The 
      overall response rate was 80.5% (161 out of 200 students). The overall mean 
      perceived stress was 30.84 (SD = 7.01) and was significantly higher among female 
      students. By logistic regression analysis, stressed cases were associated with 
      occurrence of psychosocial (OR 5.01, 95% CI 2.44-10.29) and academic related 
      stressors (OR 3.17 95% CI 1.52-6.68). The most common sources of stress were related 
      to academic and psychosocial concerns. 'High parental expectations', 'frequency of 
      examinations', 'vastness of academic curriculum', 'sleeping difficulties', 'worrying 
      about the future', 'loneliness', 'becoming a doctor', 'performance in periodic 
      examinations' were the most frequently and severely occurring sources of stress. 
      There was a negative but insignificant correlation between perceived stress and 
      academic performance (r = -0.099, p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: A higher level of perceived 
      stress was reported by the students. The main stressors were related to academic and 
      psychosocial domains. Further studies are required to test the association between 
      stressed cases and gender, academic stressors and psychosocial stressors.

TI  - Role of L-carnitine in male infertility.
PG  - 732-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the free L-camitine helps in maintaining 
      normal fertility. METHODS: The present descriptive study was designed to show 
      comparison of seminal free L-carnitine and sperm quality. Case controlled convenient 
      sampling was used to assess infertile male subjects from fertile. A total of 61 
      adult males were selected by consent, and were categorized as fertile and infertile 
      on the basis of history and semen analysis. Subjects were selected from Infertility 
      Clinic, Reproductive Health Services Centre of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, 
      Karachi. Subject's with history of pelvic surgery, or suffering from diabetes 
      mellitus, thyroid diseases or using steroids, antihypertensives and antipsychotics 
      drugs were excluded from the study. Groups were compared using student's t-test and 
      p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean values of 
      sperm count, total motility and normal morphology of asthenospermic and 
      oligoasthenoteratospermic were found significantly (p < 0.05) lower when compared 
      with fertile (control). When levels of seminal free L-carnitine were compared among 
      groups, the result showed that infertile subjects had significantly lower (P < 
      0.001) when compared to fertile subjects with lowest concentration in azoospermic 
      group. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggested that L-carnitine level in 
      seminal plasma plays an essentialrole in maintaining male fertility. However larger 
      studies on Pakistani population with this approach are warranted.

TI  - Prevalence and Severity of Depression in a Pakistani Population with at least One 
      Major Chronic Disease.
PG  - OC05-OC10
LID - 10.7860/JCDR/2017/27519.10329 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diabetes, anaemia, hypertension and asthma are major contributors to 
      morbidity in our society. Depression is the commonest psychological malady diagnosed 
      in hospital settings. There tends to be some overlap between certain chronic 
      systemic illnesses and depressive disorders, this point towards the need to 
      determine relationships between them, if any. AIM: To determine the prevalence and 
      compare the severity of depression among individuals diagnosed with four of the most 
      common chronic diseases in our community. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study was carried out among patients with chronic diseases visiting 
      a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan from August 2015 to August 2016. The 
      Beck Depression Inventory-II*, a 21-item self-report instrument was used to assess 
      the severity of depression. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square 
      test while intergroup comparisons were performed using one way ANOVA test. Logistic 
      regression was employed to estimate the odds of Category B depression (moderate and 
      severe levels of depression) in chronic diseases. RESULTS: The prevalence of 
      anaemia, hypertension, diabetes and asthma was 90%, 47%, 26% and 23% respectively. 
      Predictors of Category B depression were anaemia (OR=4.21, 95% CI: 1.30-13.56) and 
      diabetes (OR=2.03, 95% CI: 1.09-3.77). Asthma predicted Category B depression in 
      males (OR=1.26, 95% CI: 0.29-5.42) but not in females (OR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.39-1.52). 
      Individuals with hypertension were less likely to report Category B depression than 
      non-hypertensive (OR=0.72, 95% CI 0.43-1.21). Female gender had a greater influence 
      to develop Category B depression than males (OR= 2.96, 95% CI: 1.93-4.55). 
      CONCLUSION: Our study points towards a strong correlation between depression and 
      chronic diseases especially anaemia and diabetes. This cautions medical 
      practitioners against treatment of depressive disorders and chronic diseases as 
      separate, independent entities.

TI  - Cross-Sectional Survey of Healthcare Provisions for Female Tuberculosis Patients in 
      Specialized Pulmonary Division from Low Socioeconomic Class in Lahore, Pakistan.
PG  - e1133
LID - 10.7759/cureus.1133 [doi]
LID - e1133
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate various healthcare provisions for women 
      affected with tuberculosis (TB) from low socioeconomic status and their health 
      seeking behaviors, also whether or not patients feel stigmatized about their 
      disease. INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary tuberculosis has more prevalence in Pakistan as 
      compared to western countries where it occurs predominantly in the immunocompromised 
      individuals and immigrants of certain countries. It is a contagious disease and 
      Pakistan stands at the fifth position with maximum reported cases each year. 
      METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried at Gulab Devi Hospital, a public sector 
      hospital located in Lahore, through a questionnaire-based survey followed by 
      interviewing all participants. Two hundred seventy-seven female patients, who were 
      already diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, were included in the study. The 
      sample was drawn by non-probability, convenience sampling. Literacy, a major 
      contributor to socioeconomic status, was taken primary criteria to select the sample 
      for the study. RESULTS: The study shows that literacy of patients has no impact on 
      whether they feel stigmatized due to their disease as 42% (45 out of 108) of the 
      literate women felt stigmatized while 39% (65 out of 169) of illiterate women also 
      presented with similar feelings. Furthermore, the research also showed that these 
      patients have no effect on requiring permission for going to the health facility as 
      the study revealed that 62% (67 out of 108) in the literate women required 
      permission while 67% (113 out of 169) illiterate women required permission. 
      CONCLUSION: Pakistani population must be educated about TB and factors associated 
      with the progression and consequences of the disease. It was noted that even 
      educated people feel embarrassed when they develop symptoms of TB, thereby causing 
      the unprecedented delay in effective disease management. To conclude, TB clinic 
      should be opened in each community so that people have easy access to treatment of 
      the disease.

AB  - The epidemiological aspects of Theileria orientalis in Pakistan are unknown; 
      therefore, investigations using sensitive and precise molecular techniques are 
      required. This study reports the first molecular characterisation of T. orientalis 
      detected from imported (Bos taurus) and native cattle (Bos indicus×Bos taurus) and 
      buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) selected from four districts of Punjab, Pakistan. DNA 
      samples from blood (n=246) were extracted and tested using conventional PCR 
      utilising the major piroplasm surface protein (MPSP) gene and multiplexed tandem PCR 
      (MT-PCR). Theileria orientalis DNA was detected (15%; 22/147) only in imported 
      cattle by conventional PCR, whereas 24.5% (36/147), 6% (3/50) and 6.1% (3/49) of the 
      imported cattle and native Pakistani cattle and buffaloes, respectively were 
      test-positive for T. orientalis using MT-PCR. Using MT-PCR, the prevalence of T. 
      orientalis was significantly higher (P<0.0001) in imported cattle compared to that 
      of detected in native Pakistani bovines. The prevalence of T. orientalis and DNA 
      copies of chitose and ikeda were significantly higher (P<0.05) in imported cattle 
      than those detected in native Pakistani bovines. DNA sequencing of amplicons of the 
      conventional PCR revealed the presence of buffeli, chitose and ikeda genotypes of T. 
      orientalis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the MPSP sequences of buffeli, 
      chitose and ikeda from imported cattle were closely related to those sequences 
      reported previously from Australia and other regions. This study provides the first 
      survey of T. orientalis infection in imported and native bovines in Pakistan, and 
      highlights the need for future studies to understand the spread of transboundary 
      animal diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D status is a key determinant of maternal and neonatal health. 
      Deficiency has been reported to be common in Pakistani women, but information 
      regarding environmental and genetic determinants of vitamin D status is lacking in 
      this population. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among three groups of 
      healthy women living in Lahore, Pakistan: university students, students or employees 
      of Medrasas or Islamic Institutes, and employees working in office, hospital or 
      domestic settings. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify environmental and 
      genetic determinants of vitamin D status: polymorphisms in genes encoding the 
      vitamin D receptor, vitamin D 25-hydroxylase enzyme CYP2R1 and vitamin D binding 
      protein [DBP] were investigated. We also conducted analyses to identify determinants 
      of body ache and bone pain in this population, and to determine the sensitivity and 
      specificity of testing for hypocalcaemia and raised serum alkaline phosphatase to 
      screen for vitamin D deficiency. RESULTS: Of 215 participants, 156 (73 %) were 
      vitamin D deficient (serum 25[OH]D <50 nmol/L). Risk of vitamin D deficiency was 
      independently associated with illiteracy (adjusted OR 4.0, 95 % CI 1.03-15.52, 
      P = 0.04), <30 min sun exposure per day (adjusted OR 2.13, 95 % CI 1.08-4.19, 
      P = 0.02), sampling in January to March (adjusted OR 2.38, 95 % CI 1.20-4.70), 
      P = 0.01) and lack of regular intake of multivitamins (adjusted OR 2.61, 95 % CI 
      1.32-5.16, p = 0.005). Participants with the GG genotype of the rs4588 polymorphism 
      in the gene encoding vitamin D binding protein tended to have lower 25(OH)D 
      concentrations than those with GT/TT genotypes (95 % CI for difference 22.7 to -0.13 
      nmol/L, P = 0.053). Vitamin D deficiency was independently associated with increased 
      risk of body ache or bone pain (adjusted OR 4.43, 95 % CI 2.07 to 9.49, P = 0.001). 
      Hypocalcaemia (serum calcium concentration ≤9.5 mg/dL) and raised alkaline 
      phosphatase concentration (≥280 IU/L) had low sensitivity and very low specificity 
      for identification of vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency is 
      common among healthy women of child-bearing age in Lahore, Pakistan: illiteracy, 
      decreased sun exposure and lack of multivitamin intake are risk factors.

TI  - Prevalence of and factors associated with obesity among Pakistani schoolchildren: a 
      school-based, cross-sectional study.
PG  - 242-7
AB  - Childhood obesity is nowadays a concern in the developing world. This cros-sectional 
      study was conducted on 501 randomly selected students from 10 high schools in an 
      urban setting in Hyderabad, Pakistan. Children who were underweight were excluded. 
      Interviews were conducted to determine demographic data, dietary intake, physical 
      activity and other variables that may be associated with obesity. Overall 58 
      students (12%) had body mass index (BMI)>or=95th percentile, 40 (8%) BMI>or=85th 
      percentile and 403 (80%) had BMI<85th percentile (WHO age- and sex-specific 
      cut-offs). The prevalence of obesity was higher in boys than girls (15% than 8% 
      respectively). In multivariate regression analysis significant risk factors for 
      obesity/overweight were male sex, middle socioeconomic status, poor self-rated 
      athletic ability, trying to lose weight and eating fruit<4 times per week. Childhood 
      obesity is determined by factors in the home, school and society and a 
      multidisciplinary approach is needed to prevention.

TI  - Revising an objective structured clinical examination in a resource-limited 
      Pakistani Medical School.
PG  - 209
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) has not been used 
      extensively in undergraduate medical education in resource-constrained locations, 
      including Pakistan. The Shifa College of Medicine (SCM) in Islamabad modified an 
      end-of-clerkship OSCE assessment in internal medicine for final year medical 
      students from a previous static, pattern-recognition format to an interactive, 
      clinical reasoning and skill-based format. METHODS: We modified the OSCE to be more 
      dynamic and effective by creating a customized clinical skills laboratory, using 
      standardized patients, developing competency checklists for OSCE stations, and 
      stimulating more active participation from faculty members. Students were surveyed 
      at the end of their medicine clerkship about the OSCE's organization, content, 
      perceived utility and validity and its stressfulness. Faculty involved in the 
      modified format also reported their perceptions in an open-ended survey. RESULTS: 
      The modified format was generally received positively by students and faculty. 
      Twenty-eight percent of students found the OSCE to be stressful, which is a lower 
      proportion than reported in the literature in other settings. Students suggested 
      that OSCEs should be given more frequently and come with clearer instructions, and 
      they indicated a need for better training in counseling skills. Responses from 
      faculty were generally positive even though the modified format was regarded as more 
      labor-intensive and time-consuming. CONCLUSION: The OSCE, in its true sense, can be 
      created and successfully implemented to assess the clinical skills of medical 
      students in a resource-limited setting in the developing world.

TI  - Masculinity beliefs and willingness to seek help among young men in the United 
      Kingdom and Pakistan.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1080/13548506.2020.1847301 [doi]
AB  - Health-related behaviors including help-seeking are related to men's felt and 
      perceived masculinity. This study explored whether findings from studies of links 
      between masculinity and health-related behavior in developed 'western' contexts 
      applied in the more strongly patriarchal cultural context of Pakistan. Online 
      questionnaires were completed by male university students aged 17-30: 307 in 
      Pakistan and 105 in the United Kingdom. Analyses revealed that compared to British 
      men, Pakistani respondents had less egalitarian beliefs about gender relations, gave 
      more importance to their own masculinity, considered non-traditional behaviors to 
      have greater negative implications for men's masculinity, and were less willing to 
      seek help. Among Pakistani men, lower willingness to seek help for physical and 
      mental health was predicted by having less egalitarian gender beliefs, giving 
      greater importance to personal masculinity, and considering non-traditional 
      behaviors to have greater negative implications for men's masculinity. Among British 
      men, greater perceived masculinity of help seeking predicted help seeking for 
      physical concerns, and less importance of personal masculinity predicted help 
      seeking for mental health. The results highlight a need for sensitivity to men's 
      gender identity concerns when providing and encouraging use of health care, and to 
      be aware of how cultural norms shape individuals' beliefs and behavior.

      Cross-Sectional Survey.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1007/s10900-020-00875-z [doi]
AB  - Exceptional precautionary measures have been adopted to stop the transmission and 
      control of COVID-19 through the world and Pakistan is facing lockdown in this 
      scenario. Public loyalty to precautionary measures is affected by their knowledge, 
      attitude, risk factors and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. The present study was 
      conducted among the Pakistani residents to observe the knowledge, attitude, 
      practices and risk factors towards COVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan. A questionnaire 
      was designed, and a cross-sectional survey was conducted among participants of the 
      study area. Participants were asked the questions regarding knowledge, attitude, 
      practices and risk factors towards COVID-19. Data were analyzed by SPSS and t/F test 
      and correlation was applied among the knowledge, attitude, risk factors and 
      practices. A total of 1060 questionnaires were received. 1004 were included while 56 
      were excluded. The highest representation was from Punjab province (65.6%), female 
      (63%) and age group of 21-30 years (62.1%). Most participants were single (85%), 
      Muslim (99.4%), Urdu speaking (45.6%) and were graduates (51.5%). Most of the 
      participants were students (52.9%) and were from economically middle-class families 
      (40.8%). The knowledge was positively correlated with attitude and practices whereas 
      negatively correlated with risk factors (P < 0.05). The attitude was negatively 
      correlated with risk factor and positively correlated with practices. The risk 
      factors and practices were positively correlated with each other. Health education 
      program to improve the COVID-19 knowledge, attitude, practices and risk factors 
      should be initiated to combat current health challenge.

AB  - All blood bank services, especially those of developing countries, face a major 
      shortfall of blood donations due to lack of voluntary blood donors. Our study aims 
      to evaluate the acceptability of Short Message Service based interventions towards 
      becoming voluntary blood donors among medical university students of Karachi, 
      Pakistan. Methods. A total of 350 medical students were approached in medical 
      universities of Karachi, Pakistan, using a nonprobability convenient sampling 
      technique. Data collectors administered a self-made questionnaire to each 
      participant using an interview based format. All data was recorded and analyzed on 
      SPSS 16. Results. 350 participants, having a mean age of 21.47 ± 1.36, were included 
      in our study with 30.6% (107/350) being males and 69.4% (243/350) being females. 
      93.4% (327/350) of participants agreed that donating blood was healthy, but only 26% 
      had donated blood in the past with 79.1% donating voluntarily. 65.7% (230/350) of 
      the participants agreed to take part in Short Message Service based behavioral 
      interventions to become voluntary blood donors with 69.7% (244/350) also agreeing 
      that Short Message Service reminders will promote them to donate blood more often. 
      Conclusion. With university students willing to become voluntary blood donors, 
      Pakistani blood banks can carry out Short Message Service based interventions to 
      encourage them to donate blood.

TI  - Breast Cancer knowledge and perceived barriers to help seeking among pre-clinical 
      and clinical female medical students of King Edward Medical University, Lahore: a 
      cross-sectional study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women and second most 
      common cancer after lung cancer. The prognosis of breast cancer depends on early 
      detection and intervention which in turn relies upon awareness. Health workers in 
      all communities are responsible for educating the population at risk. This study 
      evaluates the knowledge regarding breast cancer, personal judgment of confidence, 
      perceived barriers to help seeking and breast self-examination practices among 
      Pakistani female medical students and studies the impact of clinical training on the 
      studied variables. METHODS: Descriptive cross-sectional study design using 
      self-administered validated questionnaires (BCAM-Breast Cancer Awareness Measure 
      designed by Cancer Research UK) was employed. Female medical students enrolled in 
      clinical and pre-clinical classes of King Edward Medical University, Lahore were 
      targeted and questioned regarding symptoms, risk factors and their practices 
      regarding breast cancer. Possible barriers to seeking help were also studied. 
      RESULT: The mean number of symptoms correctly identified was 6.7 ± 3.2 (5.5 ± 3.2 
      for pre-clinical and 7.8 ± 2.9 for clinical students) and for risk factors it was 
      4.3 ± 2.1 (3.7 ± 2.1 for pre-clinical and 4.7 ± 2.2 for clinical students). The 
      difference in the level of perception of two groups was found to be significant 
      (p < 0.001 for symptoms and p < 0.001 for risk factors). 38.7% of the subjects 
      responded that they check their breasts rarely, 33.1% were fairly confident while 
      8.6% were very confident about detecting a change in their breast, 50.0% never 
      noticed a change in their breast, and 77.4% will contact a doctor within a week or 
      less of finding a change in their breast. Confidence about detecting a change 
      significantly improved (p < 0.001) after the start of clinical training. CONCLUSION: 
      This study suggests that clinical training may have improved knowledge of female 
      medical students regarding breast cancer; yet the knowledge related to the symptoms 
      and risk factors of breast cancer and frequency of breast self-examination of female 
      medical students is less than anticipated.

TI  - Attitude of teaching faculty towards statistics at a medical university in Karachi, 
      Pakistan.
PG  - 166-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statistics is mainly used in biological research to verify the 
      clinicians and researchers findings and feelings, and gives scientific validity for 
      their inferences. In Pakistan, the educational curriculum is developed in such a way 
      that the students who are interested in entering in the field of biological sciences 
      do not study mathematics after grade 10. Therefore, due to their fragile background 
      of mathematical skills, the Pakistani medical professionals feel that they do not 
      have adequate base to understand the basic concepts of statistical techniques when 
      they try to use it in their research or read a scientific article. The aim of the 
      study was to assess the attitude of medical faculty towards statistics. METHODS: A 
      questionnaire containing 42 close-ended and 4 open-ended questions, related to the 
      attitude and knowledge of statistics, was distributed among the teaching faculty of 
      Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS). One hundred and sixty-seven filled 
      questionnaires were returned from 374 faculty members (response rate 44.7%). 
      RESULTS: Forty-three percent of the respondents claimed that they had 'introductive' 
      level of statistics courses, 63% of the respondents strongly agreed that a good 
      researcher must have some training in statistics, 82% of the faculty was in favour 
      (strongly agreed or agreed) that statistics was really useful for research. Only 17% 
      correctly stated that statistics is the science of uncertainty. Half of the 
      respondents accepted that they have problem of writing the statistical section of 
      the article. 64% of the subjects indicated that statistical teaching methods were 
      the main reasons for the impression of its difficulties. 53% of the faculty 
      indicated that the co-authorship of the statistician should depend upon his/her 
      contribution in the study. Gender did not show any significant difference among the 
      responses. However, senior faculty showed higher level of the importance for the use 
      of statistics and difficulties of writing result section of articles as compared to 
      junior faculty. CONCLUSION: The study showed a low level of knowledge, but high 
      level of the awareness for the use of statistical techniques in research and 
      exhibited a good level of motivation for further training.

TI  - Gender and stress perception based differences in BMI, hormonal response and 
      appetite in adult Pakistani population.
PG  - 705-9
LID - 10.2014/JCPSP.705709 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the gender based variations in stress perception 
      induced changes in leptin, cortisol and serotonin (5-HT) trends, appetite and Body 
      Mass Index (BMI). STUDY DESIGN: An analytical comparative study. PLACE AND DURATION 
      OF STUDY: Neurochemistry Laboratory, University of Karachi, from January to August 
      2013. METHODOLOGY: Appetite, BMI and serum leptin, cortisol, and 5-HT were measured 
      in 100 men and women of aged 30-60 years, working in teaching institutes of Karachi, 
      to evaluate gender based, stress perception induced variations. The samples were 
      identified by stratified random technique. The chemical variables were estimated 
      through ELISA. RESULTS were analysed using one-way ANOVA and multivariate general 
      linear model using SPSS version 17. RESULTS: Mean stress perception, BMI and serum 
      leptin levels were significantly more in women (p<0.05). Serum cortisol and 5-HT 
      were found significantly reduced in women (p<0.05). BMI, serum cortisol and leptin 
      were found to be increased with increasing level of stress perception (p<0.05). VAS 
      for hunger and desire to eat as the measure of appetite was significantly higher in 
      men (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Stress perception attenuates the positive effect of 
      cortisol and negative effects of leptin and 5-HT on appetite through changes in 
      their circulatory levels. Women perceive more stress and exhibit significantly 
      attenuated changes in hormonal levels and appetite which may be the contributing 
      factor towards obesity. Increased BMI in women despite decreased appetite merits 
      more studies.

      countries: the Pakistani experience.
PG  - 31
LID - 10.1186/1472-6920-12-31 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Government of Pakistan identified 4 medical Colleges for 
      introduction of COME, one from each province. Curriculum was prepared by the faculty 
      of these colleges and launched in 2001 and despite concerted efforts could not be 
      implemented. The purpose of this research was to identify the reasons for delay in 
      implementation of the COME curriculum and to assess the understanding of the 
      stakeholders about COME. METHODS: Mixed methods study design was used for data 
      collection. In-depth interviews, mail-in survey questionnaire, and focus group 
      discussions were held with the representatives of federal and provincial 
      governments, Principals of medical colleges, faculty and students of the designated 
      colleges. Rigor was ensured through independent coding and triangulation of data. 
      RESULTS: The reasons for delay in implementation differed amongst the policy makers 
      and faculty and included thematic issues at the institutional, programmatic and 
      curricular level. Majority (92% of the faculty) felt that COME curriculum couldn't 
      be implemented without adequate infrastructure. The administrators were willing to 
      provide financial assistance, political support and better coordination and felt 
      that COME could improve the overall health system of the country whereas the faculty 
      did not agree to it. CONCLUSION: The paper discusses the reasons of delay based on 
      findings and identifies the strategies for curriculum change in established 
      institutions. The key issues identified in our study included frequent transfer of 
      faculty of the designated colleges and perceived lack of: Continuation at the policy 
      making level. Communication between the stakeholders. Effective leadership.

TI  - The Educational and Employment Aspirations of Adolescents from Areas of High 
      Deprivation in London.
PG  - 1126-40
LID - 10.1007/s10964-015-0347-4 [doi]
AB  - Adolescents from areas of high deprivation are often assumed to have low aspirations 
      for the future. However, recent research has suggested otherwise and there have been 
      calls for more substantial investigation into the relationship between poverty and 
      aspiration. This article reports levels and variation in aspiration from 1214 
      adolescents (49.5 % male; 50.5 % female) living in areas of high deprivation across 
      20 London boroughs. A strength of this study is our large and diverse population of 
      low socio-economic status (SES) adolescents, comprising of white British (22 %), 
      black African (21 %), black Caribbean (9 %), Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi/Other 
      Asian (24 %), mixed ethnicity (9 %), and 15 % defining themselves as Other. Our 
      measures indicated a high group level of reported aspiration with notable 
      variations. Females reported higher educational (but not occupational) aspirations 
      than males; white British students reported lower educational and occupational 
      aspirations than other ethnic groups; and black African children reported the 
      highest educational aspirations. Perceived parental support for education had the 
      largest positive association with aspirations. In contrast to previous findings from 
      studies carried out in the United States, aspirations were found to be negatively 
      associated with perceptions of school and school peer environment. These measures 
      explored feelings of safety, happiness and belonging within the school environment 
      and school peer group. We discuss possible explanations for this unexpected finding 
      within our population of adolescents from UK state schools and how it might affect 
      future policy interventions. This study makes an important contribution to the 
      literature on adolescent aspirations because of the unique nature of the data sample 
      and the multiple domains of functioning and aspiration measured.

TI  - Ethical violations in the clinical setting: the hidden curriculum learning 
      experience of Pakistani nurses.
PG  - 16

LID - 16
AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of the hidden curriculum is recognised as a practical 
      training ground for the absorption of medical ethics by healthcare professionals. 
      Pakistan's healthcare sector is hampered by the exclusion of ethics from medical and 
      nursing education curricula and the absence of monitoring of ethical violations in 
      the clinical setting. Nurses have significant knowledge of the hidden curriculum 
      taught during clinical practice, due to long working hours in the clinic and 
      front-line interaction with patients and other practitioners. METHODS: The means of 
      inquiry for this study was qualitative, with 20 interviews and four focus group 
      discussions used to identify nurses' clinical experiences of ethical violations. 
      Content analysis was used to discover sub-categories of ethical violations, as 
      perceived by nurses, within four pre-defined categories of nursing codes of ethics: 
      1) professional guidelines and integrity, 2) patient informed consent, 3) patient 
      rights, and 4) co-worker coordination for competency, learning and patient safety. 
      RESULTS: Ten sub-categories of ethical violations were found: nursing students being 
      used as adjunct staff, nurses having to face frequent violence in the hospital 
      setting, patient reluctance to receive treatment from nurses, the near-absence of 
      consent taken from patients for most non-surgical medical procedures, the absence of 
      patient consent taking for receiving treatment from student nurses, the practice of 
      patient discrimination on the basis of a patient's socio-demographic status, nurses 
      withdrawing treatment out of fear for their safety, a non-learning culture and, 
      finally, blame-shifting and non-reportage of errors. CONCLUSION: Immediate and 
      urgent attention is required to reduce ethical violations in the healthcare sector 
      in Pakistan through collaborative efforts by the government, the healthcare sector, 
      and ethics regulatory bodies. Also, changes in socio-cultural values in hospital 
      organisation, public awareness of how to conveniently report ethical violations by 
      practitioners and public perceptions of nurse identity are needed.

TI  - The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI): Translation, Validation, and Cross-Cultural 
      Adaptation of an Urdu Version "FSFI-U".
PG  - 244-50
LID - 10.1002/sm2.77 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is a common problem, and many 
      self-report questionnaires are available for its evaluation. Pakistani women with 
      sexual problems feel shy to consult with their physician. A validated self-report 
      questionnaire, in the local language with modest expressions is required for these 
      women. AIM: The aim of this study was to translate, cross-culturally adapt, and 
      perform a psychometric validation of an Urdu translation of the Female Sexual 
      Function Index (FSFI). METHODS: The FSFI was translated in Urdu, and its precision 
      was ascertained through reverse translation. It was pretested on 22 bilingual women 
      and refined again to reach at a reliable Urdu version of the questionnaire FSFI-U. 
      One hundred sixteen bilingual women, in a stable sexual relationship over the 
      previous 6 months were finally asked to fill out the FSFI and FSFI-U. Their sexual 
      function was then clinically evaluated and responses were compared with the clinical 
      assessment as well as with each other. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The responses were 
      analyzed through descriptive statistics for reliability, face validity, agreement 
      between the responses to the original English version and to the FSFI-U, and also 
      for test-retest consistency. The data were analyzed statistically using Cronbach's 
      alpha analysis, Intraclass correlation coefficients, Pearson correlation, and 
      Student's t-test. RESULTS: FSFI was found to be easily understandable and capable of 
      adequately evaluating and measuring various aspects of female sexual function. A 
      high degree of internal consistency was demonstrated on Cronbach's alpha analysis. 
      Cronbach's α coefficient for various domains was sufficiently high ranging from 0.84 
      to 0.97. The clinical assessment of the presence and severity of FSD also matched 
      with the self-report questionnaire. Similarly, various domains of FSFI had high 
      degree of correlation in the Urdu version of FSFI (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The Urdu 
      translation version of FSFI is valid and reliable for use in the literate population 
      of Pakistan. Rehman KU, Asif Mahmood M, Sheikh SS, Sultan T, Khan MA. The Female

TI  - Role of the husband's knowledge and behaviour in postnatal depression: a case study 
      of an immigrant Pakistani woman.
PG  - 195-201
AB  - Objective This study aims to highlight the subjective experience of an immigrant 
      Pakistani woman during postnatal depression (PND), with a special emphasis on the 
      husband's knowledge and behaviour towards PND.Methods A face-to-face interview was 
      conducted with a woman reporting symptoms of depression on the fourth day after 
      delivery. She was evaluated using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
      Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV)(1) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Rating 
      Scale (EPDRS).(2) The evaluations were completed by a qualified psychiatrist. The 
      demographic information, personal and family medical history and attitude towards 
      the child were the principal issues recorded. In addition, five items were used to 
      evaluate the husband's knowledge about PND. The EPDRS differences before and after 
      counselling were evaluated using a student t-test.Results The patient was 32 years 
      old and this was her first experience of delivery by Caesarean section. The 
      evaluation for depression confirmed the diagnosis of PND and she scored 16 on the 
      EPDRS. The husband's knowledge of PND was poor.Conclusion This case study suggests 
      that lack of social support and understanding appear to play a vital role in the 
      persistence of symptoms of PND among new mothers. Therefore, counselling of couples 
      may be an effective additional tool in treating PND.

TI  - Assessing obesity and overweight in a high mountain Pakistani population.
PG  - 526-32
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of obesity and overweight among adults in a 
      high mountain rural population of Pakistan, and to determine the correlates of 
      excess body weight. Design Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A random sample of 4203 
      adults (aged 18 years and over) was selected by stratified random sampling from 16 
      villages in north Pakistan. Trained medical students measured height, weight and 
      blood pressure. Trained interviewers obtained information from participants on 
      sociodemographic variables, use of snuff, daily cigarette consumption, hypertension 
      and family history of hypertension. Body mass index (BMI) calculated as kg/m(2) was 
      used to define overweight (BMI > or = 25 kg/m(2)) and obesity (BMI > or = 30 
      kg/m(2)). RESULTS: Using weight and height data available for 1391 men and 2754 
      women, mean BMI was 22.4 (95% CI 21.9, 22.9) for men and 22.6 (95% CI 21.9, 23.2) 
      for women. The age-adjusted prevalence of BMI > or = 25 (overweight/obesity) was 
      13.5% for men and 14.1% for women. Overweight/obesity increased with age and the 
      increase per year was identical for both men and women [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 
      1.01, 95% CI 1.01, 1.03]. Overweight/obese men and women were more likely to be 
      hypertensive (men, AOR = 3.32, 95% CI 2.16, 5.09; women, AOR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.21, 
      2.39). Overweight/obese women were more likely to work in business or as skilled 
      workers (AOR = 6.24, 95% CI 1.18, 32.83) while overweight/obese men were more likely 
      to work as government employees (AOR = 2.59, 95% CI 1.66, 4.03). Family history of 
      hypertension was a significant correlate of overweight/obesity in men (P value 
      0.004) and women (P value 0.000). Overweight/obese men and women were less likely to 
      use smokeless tobacco (men, AOR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.43, 0.97; women, AOR = 0.54, 95% CI 
      0.35, 0.85). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of risk factors for non-communicable 
      diseases (NCDs) in Pakistan is expected to increase as further epidemiologic, 
      nutritional and demographic changes occur. The assessment of excess body weight, and 
      patterns and determinants of other risk factors for NCDs is important to provide 
      useful guidelines in the planning of interventions to counter a growing problem.

AB  - Information regarding the menstrual knowledge and practices of Pakistani girls is 
      sparse. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the knowledge and practices of Pakistani 
      girls regarding menstruation. This cross-sectional study was conducted among four 
      categories of university female students of medical, pharmacy, nursing, and arts & 
      humanities during a period of 5 months (November 2016-March 2017). The data were 
      acquired using a self-administered questionnaire from 3 medical institutes, 2 
      pharmacy institutes, 3 nursing institutes and 2 arts & humanities institutes at 
      Lahore, Pakistan. The mean age of participants (N = 1777) was 20.38 ± 2.39 years. 
      Overall 39.5%, 76.1% and 29.3% respondents' provided correct answers to the 
      questions concerning menstrual cycle length, duration of menstrual bleeding and 
      source of bleeding, respectively. Regarding the understanding of menstruation, 
      around 27% understood it as monthly bleeding happening with every woman, whereas 18% 
      stated that it was a sign of adulthood. However, a small proportion believed that it 
      was removal of dirt from the body. Regarding the practices-related to menstruation, 
      there were some malpractices regarding diet and dietary intake (avoiding certain 
      foods, eating less, and less fluid intake). However, the hygienic practices were 
      found to be satisfactory. In conclusion, Pakistani university girls have some 
      misconceptions, misperceptions and malpractices related to menstruation. Our 
      findings draw attention to conduct awareness programs in order to eradicate these 
      misconceptions, myths and malpractices.

TI  - Training workshops in problem-based learning: changing faculty attitudes and 
      perceptions in a Pakistani medical college.
PG  - 440
AB  - BACKGROUND: Problem-based learning (PBL) has over the years become a learning 
      strategy established for teaching students in medicine. In order to use PBL as a 
      teaching tool, faculty must be familiar with PBL and comfortable with the role 
      transition from 'teacher' to 'facilitator'. This transition is critical for the 
      success of PBL. This article describes the faculty development process undertaken in 
      Pakistan at the onset of introduction of PBL in the curriculum. METHODS: At the 
      Foundation University Medical College (FUMC), we initiated a faculty development 
      program in PBL. The program consisted of two-day, hands-on facilitator training 
      workshops conducted five times over the year and led by in-house faculty. A total of 
      180 faculty members completed these workshops. The workshops consisted of 
      interactive sessions on the philosophy of PBL, small group dynamics, the role of the 
      facilitator, an introduction to case design, wrap-up PBL sessions and assessment in 
      PBL. Participants were provided with pre-workshop reading material in the form of 
      'PBL Handbooks', which contained details of the PBL process and specific 
      responsibilities of the facilitator. Participants were also given a chance to 
      experience the role of the facilitator by facilitating the faculty-learner group 
      through a PBL session and receiving feedback. A retrospective pre-post survey was 
      conducted to gauge changes in participants' perceptions of PBL. RESULTS: The faculty 
      reported a significant increase in their regard for PBL as an instructional paradigm 
      (p=<0.001). They also generally became more interested in empowering students with 
      self-directed learning using PBL as a teaching tool and showed a greater desire to 
      be facilitators (p=<0.001). CONCLUSION: This evaluation reveals that facilitator 
      training workshops can help not just to improve the facilitation skills of 
      participants but also to stimulate interest amongst faculty to use PBL in the 
      curriculum. Such workshops can be run in Pakistan at minimal cost: the only cost we 
      incurred was for photocopying the reading material. How much difficulty the faculty 
      will actually have serving as facilitator in the PBL process will only become 
      evident when they lead PBL groups over the coming year.

AB  - Data from an ethnically diverse sample of middle school students (grades 6-8; n = 
      5,423) are analyzed for ethnic differences in suicidal ideation, thoughts about 
      suicide in the past 2 weeks, suicide plans, and suicide attempts. Ideation was 
      examined using a four-item scale and a single item on suicidal thoughts. Ideation 
      was higher among females, older youths, and lower status youths. The same general 
      pattern held for recent suicidal plans and attempts, with the exception of gender, 
      where the trend was for males to report more attempts. Lifetime plans and attempts 
      were higher for females, older youths, and lower status youths. Data were sufficient 
      to compare nine ethnic groups. Multivariate logistic regression analyses, adjusting 
      for the effects of age, gender, and socioeconomic status, yielded significant odds 
      ratios using the Anglo groups as the reference, for suicidal ideation for the 
      Mexican (OR = 1.76, p < .001), Pakistani (OR = 2.0, p < .01), and Vietnamese (OR = 
      1.48, p < .05) American groups. For thoughts about suicide in the past 2 weeks, only 
      Pakistani and Mixed Ancestry youths had elevated risk. For suicidal plans in the 
      past 2 weeks, Mixed Ancestry youths (OR = 2.02, p < .05) and Pakistani youths (OR = 
      3.20, p < .01) had elevated risk. For recent attempts, only the Pakistani American 
      youths had elevated risk (OR = 3.19, p < .01). Future research needs to address 
      whether these results hold in other ethnically diverse communities and, if so, what 
      factors contribute to increased risk among some minority youth and not others.

TI  - Validation of a food frequency questionnaire for assessing macronutrient and calcium 
      intake in adult Pakistani population.
PG  - 224-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a food frequency table (FFQ) for use in urban 
      Pakistani population. STUDY DESIGN: A validation study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: 
      The Aga Khan University, Karachi, from June to November 2008. METHODOLOGY: Healthy 
      adult females, aged ³ 18 years who consented to be included in the study were 
      inducted, while males, unhealthy females, aged below 18 years or who did not consent 
      were excluded. The FFQ was administered once while 4, 24 hours recalls spread over a 
      period of one year were administered as the reference method. Daily intakes for 
      energy, protein, fat, and calcium intake were estimated for both the tools. Crude 
      and energy adjusted correlations for nutrient intakes were computed for the FFQ and 
      mean of 4, 24 hours recalls and serum N-telopeptide of type-I collagen (NTx). 
      RESULTS: The correlation coefficients for the FFQ with mean of 4, 24 hours recall 
      ranged from 0.21 for protein to 0.36 for calcium, while the correlation for nutrient 
      estimates from the FFQ with NTx ranged from -0.07 for calcium to 0.01 for energy. 
      CONCLUSION: Highly significant correlations were found for nutrient intakes 
      estimated from the FFQ vs. those estimated from the mean of 4, 24 hours recalls but 
      no correlations was found between nutrient estimates from the FFQ and serum NTx 
      levels. FFQ was concluded to be a valid tool for assessing dietary intake of adult 
      females in Pakistan.

AB  - Data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) conducted in 2009 
      consisting of 5192 Pakistani school-going adolescents was used to assess the 
      association between parent-child-relationship and physical-aggression. A 
      multilevel-weighted-cox-proportional-algorithm was performed. The overall prevalence 
      of physical-aggression was 41% of which 27% had a poor parent-child relationship. 
      Male adolescents who have a poor bond with their parents had two times the 
      prevalence of physical-aggression (95% CI: 1.82, 3.00) than those female adolescents 
      with the strong parent-child-bonding. The findings of this study implicated that the 
      poor parental bond and the role of gender as potential factors in physically 
      aggressive adolescents.

TI  - Type 2 diabetes management in Hong Kong ethnic minorities: what primary care 
      physicians need to know.
PG  - 222-8
LID - 10.12809/hkmj134035 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the demographics and compare diabetes control in ethnic 
      minority group diabetes patients with Chinese diabetes patients who are managed in 
      primary care settings and to explore strategies to improve their care. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective case series. SETTING: General Outpatient Clinic of a Hong Kong 
      Hospital Authority hospital. PATIENTS: Chinese type 2 diabetes patients and ethnic 
      minority groups who had been regularly followed up with annual assessments carried 
      out between 1 March 2012 to 28 February 2013 were recruited. Their serum levels of 
      fasting glucose, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, haemoglobin A1c 
      levels, lipid profile, blood pressure, and co-morbidities were retrieved from the 
      Clinical Management System. Student's t test and analysis of variance were used to 
      evaluate continuous variables and the Chi squared test for categorical data. All 
      statistical tests were two-sided, and a P value of <0.05 was considered significant. 
      RESULTS: Among 4346 type 2 diabetes patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 3966 
      (91.3%) patients were Chinese and 380 (8.7%) were from the ethnic minority groups. 
      Compared with Chinese diabetes patients, the latter were much younger and more obese 
      (both P<0.001). Their glycaemic control was poorer than age- and sex-matched Chinese 
      diabetes patients (P=0.006). Control of systolic blood pressure was similar in the 
      two groups, but the mean diastolic blood pressure was higher in the ethnic minority 
      groups than in the controls (78 ± 11 mm Hg vs 73 ± 11 mm Hg; P<0.001). With regard 
      to lipid control, their total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride 
      levels were similar, but high-density lipoprotein levels were much lower in the 
      ethnic minority groups than their Chinese counterparts (1.19 ± 0.33 mmol/L vs 1.28 ± 
      0.36 mmol/L; P=0.001). Among the five major ethnic minority groups with diabetes, 
      Pakistani patients had particularly poor glycaemic control and the Nepalese had the 
      poorest diastolic blood pressure control. CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic minority groups are an 
      integral part of the Hong Kong population. Compared with Chinese diabetes patients, 
      those from the ethnic minorities were much younger and more obese. Deficiencies 
      exist in the comprehensive management of diabetes in these ethnic minorities, 
      particularly with respect to glycaemic control. Culturally tailored health care 
      interventions are therefore warranted to promote patient education and clinical 
      effectiveness and to improve their long-term health status.

AB  - Breaking bad news can be an intimidating task for any physician. The aim of this 
      study was to record the practices of breaking bad news to the patients by Pakistani 
      radiologists and trainees. The radiologists and trainees attending the 26th National 
      Radiological Conference in October 2010 in Karachi, Pakistan, were surveyed. The 
      response rate was 76%. The respondents included residents (51%), private practicing 
      radiologists (28%), academic radiologists (13%), and other trainees (8%). Most of 
      the academic radiologists communicated with their patients. The daily frequency of 
      breaking bad news by residents was noted, which was highest in the public teaching 
      hospitals (71%). For severe abnormalities such as malignancy, 50% residents, 55% of 
      the academic radiologists and 74% of the private practicing radiologists were very 
      uncomfortable in disclosure of results. Differences in frequency of communication 
      with patients were noticed with both different training levels, and different 
      settings of practice in a developing country.

TI  - Implications for the practice of a patient expectation and satisfaction survey, at a 
      teaching hospital in Karachi, Pakistan.
PG  - 122-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the expectations and satisfaction of patients visiting Family 
      Practice Clinics, at the Aga Khan University Hospital, in Karachi, Pakistan. 
      METHODOLOGY: A cross sectional survey of 316 patients was carried out. A 
      questionnaire, based on the study objectives was developed and administered. The 
      participating patient signed a consent form, after assurance of confidentiality was 
      provided. Data on the demographic profile of the patients was collected. RESULTS: 
      The mean age was 33.81 years, with 105 (33.2%) women, and 211 (66.8%) men. The 
      majority were married, with education above intermediate level and were in private 
      or government service or were housewives. The median for the patient waiting time 
      was 30 minutes, against an expectation of 12.69 minutes. Reading newspaper, watching 
      television, reading magazine, reading Quran and listening to music were quoted as 
      ways to lessen the burden of waiting to see a physician. The average consultation 
      time with the physician was 13.89 minutes, against an expectation of 16.37 minutes. 
      Patient expectation in terms of listening by the doctor with patience, explanation 
      of the diagnosis and treatment, prescription of medicines, ordering of 
      investigations and specialist referral has been documented. Objections to the 
      presence of medical student, nursing student, resident doctor, nurse and an 
      observer, in the consultation room have also been documented. Reasons quoted for the 
      objection include issues of privacy/confidentiality, lack of justification, 
      discomfort, and interference with the consultation process. The expected average 
      cost for doctor's consultation was Pakistani Rs. 124, while 196 (61.8%) of the 
      respondents were satisfied with the consultation based on Rs. 70. CONCLUSION: We 
      have collected important information to improve the services offered at our Family 
      Practice clinics.

TI  - Body mass, weight control behaviours, weight perception and emotional well being in 
      a multiethnic sample of early adolescents.
PG  - 1514-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate weight perception, dieting and emotional well being across 
      the range of body mass index (BMI) in a population-based multiethnic sample of early 
      adolescents. DESIGN: Cross-sectional population-based survey. SUBJECTS: In total, 
      2789 adolescents 11-14 years of age from three highly deprived regional authorities 
      in East London, in 2001. MEASUREMENTS: Data were collected by student-completed 
      questionnaire on weight perception, dieting history, mental and physical health, 
      health behaviours, social capital and sociodemographic factors. Height and weight 
      were measured by trained researchers. Overweight was defined as BMI > or =85th 
      centile and obesity as BMI > or =98th centile. Underweight was defined as BMI< or 
      =15th centile. RESULTS: In all, 73% were from ethnic groups other than white 
      British. Valid BMI were available for 2522 subjects (90.4%) of whom 14% were obese. 
      Only 20% of overweight boys and 51% of overweight girls assessed their weight 
      accurately. Accuracy of weight perception did not vary between ethnic groups. In 
      all, 42% of girls and 26% of boys reported current dieting to lose weight. Compared 
      with white British teenagers, a history of dieting was more common among 
      Bangladeshi, Indian and mixed ethnicity boys and less likely among Pakistani girls. 
      Self-esteem was not associated with BMI in girls but was significantly lower in 
      obese boys than those of normal weight (P=0.02). Within ethnic subgroups, 
      self-esteem was significantly lower in overweight white British boys (P=0.03) and 
      obese Bangladeshi boys (P=0.01) and Bangladeshi girls (P=0.04), but significantly 
      higher in obese black African girls (P=0.01) than those of normal weight. Obese 
      young people had a higher prevalence of psychological distress (P=0.04), except 
      among Bangladeshi teenagers, where overweight and obese young people had less 
      psychological distress than those of normal weight (P=0.02). Birth outside the UK 
      was associated with reduced risk of obesity in girls (P=0.02) but not with history 
      of dieting, weight perception or psychological factors in either gender. CONCLUSION: 
      High levels of current dieting for weight control and inaccurate perception of body 
      mass are common across all ethnic groups. However, dieting history and the 
      associations of obesity with self-esteem and psychological distress vary between 
      ethnic groups. Interventions to prevent or treat obesity in black or minority 
      ethnicity groups must consider cultural differences in the relationship between body 
      mass, self-esteem and psychological distress.

TI  - Psychological Predictors of Anxious Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence 
      from Pakistan.
LID - 10.30773/pi.2020.0167 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 epidemic can be associated with a variety of anxious responses 
      and safety behaviors. The present research explored the psychological implications 
      associated with COVID-19 during the outbreak in 2020 to date. Pakistani media has 
      given particular attention to this outbreak in the region. METHODS: Three hundred 
      and forty-seven undergraduate university students from Pakistan completed a battery 
      of questionnaires focusing fear of COVID-19, associated safety behaviors, factual 
      knowledge of COVID-19, and other psychological pointers hypothesized to be as 
      predictors of anxious responses to COVID-19 threat and associated safety behaviors. 
      RESULTS: The sample appeared to be fearful of COVID-19 and this fear was related to 
      disgust sensitivity, anxiety sensitivity-related physical concerns, body vigilance, 
      contamination cognitions, and general distress. Results suggested that the tendency 
      of overestimating the severity of contamination and anxiety sensitivity towards 
      physical concerns are significant predictors of COVID-19 related fear and consequent 
      safety behaviors. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that people with a greater concern of 
      contamination are likely to respond fearfully to COVID-19 and that people with 
      higher fear of COVID-19 are likely to feel contamination concerns.

TI  - Intimate partner violence against women in Pakistan: a review of qualitative 
      research.
PG  - 892-903
LID - 10.5455/JPMA.20759 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To consolidate research data and provide an insight into areas that need 
      further research regarding intimate partner violence. METHODS: The review targeted 
      qualitative research-based studies done in the English language and conducted in 
      Pakistan from 2008 to 2018 regarding intimate partner violence against women. A 
      thorough search of Google Scholar and PubMed databases was done. Data from each 
      selected article was extracted using a data-extraction template. RESULTS: Of the 
      2,479 results, 21(0.8%) articles were selected along with 4(0.16%) texts from grey 
      literature. An in-depth analysis led to six broad categories: 
      experiences/perspectives of married women facing intimate partner violence; 
      perspectives of married men towards intimate partner violence; perspectives of 
      religious leaders who support the idea of men controlling their wives; societal 
      norms, such as dowry, patriarchy and daughters being considered a burden; impact on 
      women and family as damage to the women's physical and mental health affects not 
      only her but also the society as a whole; and coping strategies used by most women. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The review helps in understanding the common trends and situation of 
      Pakistani women who are exposed to violence, the common limitations faced by 
      researches, and areas which require further research to prevent intimate partner 
      violence.

      in a country with developing economy.
PG  - 364-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the risk factors (RF) profile and prevalence rates of high risk 
      factors in an urban Pakistani community and compare it to the RF profile and 
      prevalence rates of Pakistan National Health Survey. METHODS: The present study 
      included RF relevant data of 400 house hold children selected by open invitation as 
      a part of Metroville Health Study (MHS), a risk factor modification study which was 
      a cooperation between National Heart Lung Blood institute (NHLBI) USA and National 
      Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases Pakistan. The base line data of 389 girls and 
      417 boys age 5-17 was included. PMRC data of 5067 and NHANES III survey data of 
      10,252 US children was used for comparison with MHS. RF analyzed were height weight, 
      SBP, DBP, BMI and serum cholesterol. Comparisons between MHS and PMRC and US were 
      made by using two tailed student t test and of high RF were defined as those 
      exceeding US standards and expressed as percentages. RESULTS: The RF factor profile 
      of urban Metroville children was worse than the national average of PMRC children. 
      Except for diastolic blood pressure in both boys and girls and SBP in PMRC boys, all 
      other RF were less than US children. Prevalence rates were higher in urban 
      Metroville community, i.e., MHS compared to the PMRC which represents national 
      average data. CONCLUSION: RF profile of Pakistani children has been presented and 
      effect of urbanization demonstrated by comparing the PMRC and MHS RF profile. 
      Hypertension in Pakistani children has emerged as a single most important RF 
      requiring urgent prevention.

TI  - Between a Rock and a Hard Place - Gender Dysphoria and Comorbid Depression in a

AB  - Gender dysphoria (GD) describes an incongruence between a person's assigned and 
      expressed gender and the distress associated with it. The management of GD ideally 
      involves a team of healthcare professionals, including psychiatrists, 
      endocrinologists, and surgeons, and may include one or more of the following 
      - psychotherapy, hormone therapy, and gender reassignment surgeries. While Pakistan 
      still has a sizeable population of the traditional 'khwaja siras' or 'hijras,' many 
      young transgender Pakistanis are now adopting global transgender identities and 
      seeking sex-reassignment procedures from a state-run healthcare system, which still 
      heavily discriminates against them. In spite of the passage of a new law protecting 
      the fundamental human rights of transgendered Pakistanis, they continue to be 
      oppressed and deprived of education, employment, and healthcare. This case report 
      describes one such young transman from a low-income Pakistani household, who, owing 
      to the legal red tape, family pressure, religious disapproval, and hefty hospital 
      expenses, is left with only two options - to undergo unsafe, unstandardized 
      procedures at the hands of quacks or live the rest of his life trapped in the wrong 
      body. There is a dire need for a wide-scale awareness campaign to educate and 
      sensitize the general public about transgender rights. Medical students must also be 
      exposed to transgender patients during their medical school training in order to 
      familiarize them with the special medical needs of transgender individuals.

TI  - Characteristics of menopause in three socioeconomic urban groups in Karachi, 
      Pakistan.
PG  - 61-9
AB  - To determine age, symptoms and treatment choices in Pakistani women with spontaneous 
      menopause, three groups in Karachi were interviewed using a structured 
      questionnaire. The groups consisted of 250 poor slum dwellers, 250 middle class 
      clinic attenders and 150 wives of retired military officers. Interviews were carried 
      out in 1989 and 1990 by members of a team from the Aga Khan University consisting of 
      a gynaecologist, a community health physician and two senior medical students. All 
      interviewees had natural menopause at least 12 months previously. The results showed 
      a mean age of 47 years for menopause in all groups. One in five women were 
      symptomatic in the poorest group but one in two were in the other groups. Treatment 
      was sought by 6% in the poor group, 26% of the middle class group and 38% of the 
      most privileged group. Age at menopause was 4 years earlier than in most reports and 
      fewer women had menopausal symptoms. These urban women may not represent the 
      situation across the country but, as life expectancy in Pakistan is rising (now 56.4 
      years for women), menopausal problems may increase.
